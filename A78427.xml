            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But now, it may peradventure ſeem ſtrange,<note place="margin">2. Why any mor Bookes of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject.</note> why af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo long ſilence (in the Sabbaticall controverſies) and after ſo many books of this ſubject, intended for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of conſcientious Christians, we ſhould now again revive that contestation, and trouble the world with, not only a new, but a larger diſcourſe of that kind: We ſhall therefore briefly give an account of our aimes and intentions herein. And our first anſwer is, that this work was undertaken (as ſoon as any) many years ago, and well nigh finiſhed, when <hi>nothing</hi> was written <hi>for,</hi> but <hi>all againſt</hi> the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Secondly, here thou ſhalt expect a larger undertaking, and find (we hope) a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther performance, than in any, in all the tractates writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> For they commonly deale but with our ſingle Adverſary, but we with all: And we being ſpectators of their combates, perhaps might ſee better than themſelves, where their weaknes lay: What ſatisfaction they have given to themſelves or others, we do not well know, but for our ſelves we must, (with all modesty and due reſpect to the Authors) profeſſe our ſelves unſatisfied by either party. Thirdly, here thou
<pb facs="tcp:112963:7"/>
ſhalt find fuller grounds laid, for the clearing of this ſo much perplexed controverſie, than the brevity of others would well permit, to ſay no more. Lastly, the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>non-ſatisfaction</hi> from thoſe diſcourſes, by ſome, not only oppoſites, but friends alſo to the Cauſe. In ſo much as not only the Adverſaries to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> have been confident of their Cauſe, as impoſsible to be diſproved; but alſo ſome well-willers to it, have rather wiſhed it might, than hoped it could be ſtrongly and convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained. And if we may be ſo bold as to give our Reaſon, (which we more largely ſhew in the following parts of this Diſcourſe) we ſuppoſe that this is one of the chiefe, becauſe they grant their Adverſary, <hi>That the Saturday Sabbath, was literally enjoyned in the 4. Commandement,</hi> which (we think) whoſoever grants, he hath lost, not only the Cauſe, but the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too. Or if ſome do deny it, yet they do not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confute it, to ours, or others ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. Why this part without the reſt.</note>But then a further <hi>Quaere</hi> may be, why (if we will needs be writing now) this part comes forth alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its fellowes. For that, be pleaſed to conſider our Reaſons. <hi>1.</hi> That we might not give the world ſome cauſe, to nauſeate at, or ſurfet upon too great a volume on the ſudden, having been ſo long accustomed to leſſer meales, and lighter meats of Pamphlets. Neither mens minds, nor their leiſure, nor perhaps their purſes (many of them) will permit to adventure upon larger Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>2.</hi> This part, being the foundation of all the rest, if it be ſtrong, will do much alone, to prepare mens minds to admit of the following parts: If it ſhall any way prove weak, (diſcovered to us by the cenſures of many Readers
<pb facs="tcp:112963:7"/>
both friends and foes) we ſhall endevour to ſtrengthen it, before we proceed to lay on the waight of the rest of the building. <hi>3.</hi> This, though first in order, was last in time, in regard of the frame and compoſure, as being a work of Time, and many ſad thoughts, in a path little or not at all trodden by any Authors gone before us: and ſo neceſsitating a review of the following parts; for which (as yet) we have no leiſure; yet unwilling we are, that this, which (we hope) is able to ſubſist of it ſelf, ſhould ſtay for the rest. To adde but one thing more: The world, as it was not in former times, ſo nor is it yet (we feare) well able to beare the following more practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call parts, till they be throughly perſwaded of the truth of this. It is very well known that the Profanation of the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> amongst the <hi>Jewes,</hi> was one of their chiefest deſolating ſins; and they never began to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in obſervation of it, till they had ſmarted ſeventy yeares in the Babylonian captivity. And till the ſpirits of men be well broken, the ſtrict, and but due obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> will be thought an intollerable burden. Succeſſe in the entertainment of other truths, (not long ſince thought impoſsible to be effected) upon theſe fearful breaches now among us, makes us conceive that this Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> will be alſo ere long, more eaſily digeſted. And this part is on purpoſe premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as a preparatory to thoſe more practicall parts.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhould further be inquiſitive to know, why we do ſo much aſſert and confirme our own Poſitions, in this former part, with ſo little Refutation of ſo much as hath been ſaid by the other party; Our anſwer, is, that most of theſe Aſſertions (at least ſome) are new, and
<pb facs="tcp:112963:8"/>
perhaps unexpected to our Adverſaries, and therefore nothing could be ſaid by them against them: But prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally becauſe the objections do fall upon the other parts more properly and methodically, and there ſhall be conſidered to the full.</p>
            <p>For a concluſion of all, by way of Preface, we have but one word or two more to ſay, and that by way of earnest entreaty. <hi>1.</hi> That thou wilt do thy ſelf this right, and us this favour, as to lay aſide all prejudice in the diſquiſition of that truth, which we all profeſſe to ſeek, ſo to ſuſpend thy cenſure of any parcell of this part, till thou hast ſeriouſly, not only read, but weighed it all in the ballance of a ſound judgement. <hi>2.</hi> That thou wilt do the Truth that right, as to yeeld to, and practiſe what thou art convinced of. Conſider what we ſay, and the Lord give thee and us underſtanding and grace in all things through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> So pray</p>

               <p n="5">5.

               <p>And of theſe we ſay further, and clearly,<note place="margin">XIV.

               <p>And firſt, a <hi>Law Morall-Naturall,</hi> we think,<note place="margin">XV. Deſcription of a Morall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Law.</note> may thus properly be expreſt: <hi>[A</hi> Law <hi>of Things neceſſary to be done or forborne, toward</hi> God <hi>or</hi> Man, <hi>our ſelves, or others: which the Nature of Man now (though corrupted) either doth acknowledge, or may at leaſt be convinced of to be ſuch, (even without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) from Arguments drawn from thoſe Principles which are in the hearts of all men generally even now.]</hi> So that he muſt contradict ſome of thoſe Principles, which yeelds not to thoſe Lawes, ſpecially when he is rationally urged with them. Or more briefly thus: <hi>[A Law of</hi> Nature <hi>is a Law, which may be proved not only</hi> juſt, <hi>but</hi> neceſſary, <hi>by Principles drawn from the light of Nature, which all Reaſonable men have ſtill in their hearts.]</hi> We chuſe to expreſſe it thus, rather then, as ſome others doe,<note place="margin">XVI.

Some deſcribe it, by <hi>[being written in mans heart at the firſt Creation.]</hi> But this we apprehend to be a very uncertaine (not to ſay altogether impertinent) Deſcription. For if we ſhall conſider, 1. That the Scripture no where <hi>characterizes</hi> any particular Law by theſe Titles, of being a <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> or <hi>written in mans heart at the firſt Creation.</hi> 2. That all mens Natures are now <hi>corrupted;</hi> and ſo <hi>created Nature</hi> is to us at this day a <hi>merum Non-ens;</hi> with it we have nothing to doe in this Queſtion, becauſe we cannot know all that was then written in mans heart.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112963:13"/>
Gentiles;</hi> which where they finde wanting, they deny ſuch Lawes to be Lawes of Nature: And under this pretence, they ſtrongly reject (as they think) the 4. Commandement for <hi>one Day in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> from being <hi>Morall,</hi> (by which they will underſtand only <hi>Morall-Naturall</hi>) becauſe it was not written in the hearts of the Gentiles, not acknowledged, nor practiſed by them of old.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XVII. 2 Reaſons of it.</note>But this deſcription of <hi>Morall-Naturall</hi> we cannot admit, for a double Reaſon. 1. Becauſe ſome Lawes had the Teſtimony of all the Heathens Practice and Acknowledgement generally, and ſo ſeemes written in all their hearts; which yet are ſo far from being <hi>Morall-Naturall,</hi> that they were meerly <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> and are now <hi>aboliſhed;</hi> as the Law of <hi>ſacrificing ſome materiall things</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> a Sheep, or an Oxe, or Flowre, or Wine, or the like. 2. And ſpecially, becauſe the <hi>moſt undeniable Law of Nature</hi> (or one of them) that is, or can be, namely, the <hi>worſhipping of one only God,</hi> ſhall not be <hi>Morall-Naturall,</hi> if we ſtand to the proofe of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the <hi>Heathens Practice and Acknowledgement.</hi> For all that know any thing, know, that <hi>they generally</hi> (and even the very Jewes too, very often, before the Babyloniſh Captivity) worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a <hi>Plurality of Gods.</hi> If therefore the Gentiles not obſerving nor owning a ſeventh-day Sabbath, be a ſufficient proofe to evince the 4. Commandement not <hi>Morall,</hi> (though we contend not for its being <hi>Morall-Naturall,</hi> as it commands <hi>ſo much,</hi> and <hi>no more,</hi> of <hi>ſolemne Time</hi> for <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequencie</hi> together) It will not only thruſt out alſo the <hi>ſecond Commandement</hi> from being <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> becauſe it is apparent that all the World, of old, made and worſhipped Images; and ſo it is cleare, that Law was not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally written in all their hearts: But even the <hi>firſt Commandement</hi> will not be admitted to be <hi>Morall,</hi> becauſe <hi>all the World</hi> generally worſhipped a <hi>plurality of Gods:</hi> And ſo neither was the Law of <hi>[having no other Gods but the Lord]</hi> written generally in the hearts of the Gentiles: We know, ſome of the wiſer Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did indeed profeſſe but <hi>one God,</hi> as <hi>Socrates;</hi> but even for that (as they write) he was condemned to death by his ungodly Countrymen. Alſo it is certaine, that it may be proved, even from thoſe Principles of the light of Nature remaining in the hearts of all Reaſonable men now, [That <hi>there is but One GOD</hi>] and ſo, [That <hi>we are to worſhip Him alone,</hi> and ſo but <hi>One.</hi>] Whence it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112963:13"/>
followes, that as there is now no other <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Lawes</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> but our <hi>preſent Nature,</hi> however <hi>corrupted:</hi> ſo we ſay, the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be made, not ſimply according to <hi>firſt Apprehenſions,</hi> but <hi>awakened Principles.</hi>

               <p>The ſumme then of this Diſcourſe of <hi>Naturally-Morall Lawes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">XIX. Character of Laws Moral-Naturall.</note> is, That their proper Character is, <q>[To be in themſelves not only juſt and convenient, but even <hi>neceſſary,</hi> in the <hi>Nature of the Laws themſelves:</hi> for all reaſonable creatures, ſuch as Mankind, are univerſally and perpetually to ſtand obliged unto, toward GOD, themſelves, and one another: and which very Nature, though <hi>corrupted,</hi> may be forced to confeſſe ſuch.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But now beſides theſe <hi>Morall-Naturall</hi> Lawes,<note place="margin">XX. Deſcription of a Morall-Poſitive Law.</note> there are (we ſay) others, which we call <hi>Morall-Poſitive.</hi> And theſe we deſcribe to be, <q>[Laws, clearely laid down in Scripture, (in expreſſe words, or certaine conſequence) which Nature, though corrupted, cannot reaſonably deny to be <hi>juſt, good,</hi> (and ſo <hi>convenient</hi> to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, according to the Lawgivers pleaſure:) Though antecedent to His Will, ſome way revealed to them, it would not, nor could not have judged them to be of themſelves altogether neceſſary]</q>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:112963:14"/>
even <hi>corrupted,</hi> cannot deny, but that <hi>it is fit, that the Law-givers Will and Pleaſure ſhould ſtand for a Law with his Creatures:</hi> and ſo, though it could have diſcerned no <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſuch, or ſuch an <hi>Obligation,</hi> by the <hi>light of Nature meerly,</hi> (as perhaps even <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Nature</hi> could not in ſome of them) yet ſuch <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>equality</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> being in them, as they cannot but acknowledge them <hi>convenient,</hi> and <hi>fit to be perpetuated,</hi> unleſſe <hi>God</hi> have expreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the contrary. Theſe we call <hi>Morall-Poſitive Laws,</hi> and eſteem them <hi>univerſall</hi> to all their Poſteritie to whom they were given, and <hi>Perpetuall</hi> to them, from the time they were given, unto the Worlds end, and ſo to <hi>all the Church</hi> in after ages, unleſſe where <hi>God</hi> was pleaſed to make any particular <hi>exceptions</hi> or <hi>exemptions.</hi> And though we confeſſe God <hi>might</hi> have changed, or abrogated any of theſe Lawes ſo qualified, yet we doe not beleeve that He <hi>hath,</hi> unleſſe it be undeniably expreſt of this or that particular Law in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Of which perſwaſion we ſhall give our grounds in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>And now, upon this <hi>Diſtinction</hi> (if we be not deceived) the greateſt part of the preſent Controverſie in this Diſcourſe depends. It concernes us therefore to vindicate this fully, and make good this ground, before we proceed any further. And that there are ſome <hi>Poſitive</hi> Lawes in Scripture, thus <hi>Morall,</hi> that is, of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall extent</hi> (after they were once given) and <hi>perpetuall obligation,</hi> we thus endeavour to make manifeſt.</p>

For the <hi>old World,</hi> even beginning
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112963:14"/>
with <hi>Adam,</hi> and ending with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (as Divines commonly make the period) the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> was an <hi>univerſall</hi> and <hi>perpetuall Law;</hi> the practice whereof we find in the very beginning, in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> without doubt, not without ſome Divine command to their Father: and all ſucceeding Generations, even of Heathens practiſed this. 2. To <hi>Noah</hi> was a Law of this kind given, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all his Poſteritie, as cannot be denied, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. To abſtaine from <hi>eating blood;</hi> though afterward it was more ſpecially renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and applied to the Jews; and the Gentiles loſt it, as they did other things, even of the Law of Nature, as we touched before. 3. In the <hi>new World,</hi> beginning with Chriſt,<note place="margin">At leaſt for this Age.</note> and continuing till the day of Judgement, the <hi>two Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> are unqueſtionably <hi>Poſitive Lawes,</hi> yet <hi>univerſall,</hi> (as ſoon as the Goſpel comes to any) and <hi>perpetuall;</hi> and ſo may be termed <hi>Morall,</hi> from the time they were given, to the worlds end. 4. Nay, we have a Record of a Law <hi>Morall-Poſitive</hi> given to <hi>Adam,</hi> even <hi>before his fall,</hi> reaching to all his Poſterity, to the worlds end, <hi>viz. The not eating of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge.</hi> For, that it bound all men, appeares by too wofull <hi>experience,</hi> all Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſinners</hi> for <hi>breaking</hi> of it in and with <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore ſince <hi>God</hi> hath done thus from the <hi>beginning,</hi> to give <hi>Poſitive</hi> Lawes, and yet make them <hi>Morall,</hi> Univerſall, and Perpetuall; we can ſee no reaſon, but that there may be ſome other ſuch, for <hi>both</hi> Ages of the World; Only we muſt looke that we pitch our mark aright, upon thoſe that are indeed ſo.

               </argument>
               <p>THat there are <hi>Lawes</hi> of <hi>GOD, Morall,</hi> or <hi>Perpetuall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I. What Poſitive Lawes are Morall.</note> (which we henceforth take for one and the ſame thing) though but <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> we ſuppoſe to have evinced in the former Chapter. Yet we grant withall, that ſundry Lawes in Scripture, being <hi>Poſitive,</hi> are not <hi>Morall;</hi> and thoſe not only, which were <hi>ſpeciall</hi> to a Perſon or Nation, but alſo ſome of them which were <hi>generall</hi> to the firſt Age of the World, namely, untill Chriſts comming. Divers of theſe we confeſſe aboliſhed, and of no obligation under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Wherefore, that we may make uſe of our Diſtinction (and Aſſertion) of ſome Lawes <hi>Morall-Poſitive,</hi> as well as ſome <hi>Morall-Naturall;</hi> we muſt in the next place lay down, <hi>what kinde of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Lawes we hold to be ſtill in force;</hi> and <hi>upon what grounds</hi> we hold ſo of them: By giving ſome <hi>Rules,</hi> whereby it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, how far we ſtand obliged with conſcience of obedience to them. And they are theſe, or ſome of theſe, which follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">II. Rule 1.</note> [<hi>Every Law of</hi> God <hi>(though but Poſitive) recorded in the Scripture, is Morall and Perpetuall, unleſſe it be afterward found Repealed by</hi> God, <hi>or Expired in the nature of it.</hi>] We will explaine this Rule, and then prove it. 1.<note place="margin">Explained.</note> This Rule is propounded of <hi>all the Lawes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> generally, as <hi>recorded in Scripture.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Fundamentall proofe of it, is equally for both Teſtaments. 2. Becauſe ſome Lawes, not only recorded in the New Teſtament, but ſeeming to be ratified there, (as that of <hi>not eating Blood, &amp;c.</hi> of which Law we ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat anon) are taken to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward repealed. 3. Becauſe ſome Lawes or Precepts of the New Teſtament are eſteemed <hi>expired,</hi> though not repealed; as that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. of waſhing one anothers feet, Of anoynting the ſick with oyle, that they might recover, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. And perhaps ſome others are of a like nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay, All Lawes are perpetuall, except firſt <hi>God hath after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward repealed them:</hi> that we may reſerve to him the <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> of his Authority, particularly over <hi>Poſitive</hi> Lawes; which as they proceeded at firſt from his authority and pleaſure, ſo may any of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112963:17"/>
them, or all of them, at any time, by his pleaſure and authority be taken away, and repealed againe. Or, 2. <hi>It be expired:</hi> of which by and by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By Gods <hi>repealing</hi> of any Law, we underſtand, any <hi>ſentences of Scripture,</hi> particularly of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>declaring, that it is not the will of</hi> God, <hi>that ſuch Lawes ſhould any longer be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in force;</hi> whether they be named <hi>expreſly</hi> (as in ſome places they are) or comprehended under thoſe <hi>generall expreſſions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Jewiſh Ceremonies,</hi> calling them <hi>ſhadowes,</hi> and <hi>Worldly Rudiments,</hi> Col. 2. <hi>Weak and beggerly Elements,</hi> Gal. 4. <hi>Carnall Ordinances impoſed on them untill the time of Reformation,</hi> Heb. 9. and, <hi>a yoak which they were not able to beare,</hi> Act. 15. (which latter phraſe will fetch in alſo ſome of the <hi>Judicials</hi> perhaps, ſuch namely as cannot now be obſerved by particular Chriſtians without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt prejudice, much leſſe be held up by any Chriſtian State without reall and ſpeciall inconveniences.) And whatſoever comes certainly under any of theſe Termes, we eſteem and reckon it <hi>repealed,</hi> though not expreſly named. But whatſoever is without the limits of thoſe Phraſes, and not particularly mentioned <hi>as aboliſhed,</hi> we account not <hi>repealed,</hi> though poſſibly it may be <hi>expired</hi> for all that; which therefore we adde.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By a Lawes being <hi>Expired in the Nature of it,</hi> wee meane, when <hi>it was manifeſtly given, and continued for ſome particular Reaſon, which Reaſon is now manifeſtly ceaſed,</hi> and ſo without any repealing of it, it is of it ſelfe at an end in reſpect of Obligation, (though if it have no reall inconvenience in it now, it may be freely continued ſtill: and if the reaſon of it ſhould (or could) be revived, ſo would the Law be in like ſort.) And thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired are ſundry other of the <hi>Judiciall</hi> Lawes in the Old Teſtament, and thoſe forementioned in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">III. Uſually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</note>And theſe Deſcriptions of a <hi>Law repealed</hi> or <hi>expired,</hi> ſeem to be ſo ſufficient, as that it is the uſuall practice of all conſcientious Chriſtians, ſpecially Divines, that when they ſpeak of any Law of the Old Teſtament, as <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> or <hi>Judiciall,</hi> and ſo no longer in force (or any Precept of the New Teſtament not now binding us) they preſently propound either ſome <hi>expreſſe Text</hi> rejecting it now, or at leaſt ſome <hi>generall ſentence</hi> including it among thoſe that are now excluded, becauſe of ſome <hi>Typicall ſignification</hi> that it hath, and the <hi>burdenſomneſſe</hi> and inconvenience of it, if it ſhould be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112963:17"/>
ſtill counted in force; or at leaſt, the manifeſt <hi>ceaſing</hi> of the <hi>reaſon</hi> for which they conceive it was at firſt given (or after continued for a while) and ſo that there is no reaſon now, why it ſhould be counted ſtill a Law of <hi>God.</hi> Which,<note place="margin">N. B.</note> before we goe any further to adde any ſpeciall Proofs of our Rule, ſeems a tacite confeſſion of it, (which we deſire may be well noted) in that none of them goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, abſolutely or ſimply, to plead <hi>exemption</hi> from any particular Law, whether in the New or Old Teſtament, but only ſo far forth as he goes about to prove it to come under the compaſſe either of ſuch a <hi>Repeale,</hi> or an <hi>Expiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet for all this, we beleeve,<note place="margin">IV.

                  <note place="margin">V. Proved by 4. Reaſons. 1.

It is ſo in the <hi>Statute-Law</hi> of our Kingdome (and of all Kingdomes) if a man can alleadge for himſelfe in point of Right or Priviledge, (or the Kings Councell, for the Kings Rights and Prerogatives) any Statute that was once made, it ſtands good for all purpoſes, unleſſe they who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112963:18"/>
would gainſay it, can alledge and prove that ſuch a Statute is <hi>out of date,</hi> by <hi>expiration</hi> or <hi>repeale.</hi> So that the proof lyes originally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the refuſer of the Law, and they that would maintain it and urge it, need plead nothing more then the <hi>enacting</hi> of it once, till the abrogation of it can be verified.</p>
               <p>And if it be ſo in the Statutes of men, and the Poſitive Lawes of Kingdomes, much more in thoſe of God, whoſe Authority is unqueſtionably more abſolute, and whoſe Wiſedome, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Iuſtice, and Goodneſſe, is infinitely beyond that of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States in the World.</p>
               <p>This we take to be a point meriting exceeding much conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though we find cauſe to doubt, it is but little conſidered, even by many Chriſtians and Divines.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">VI. 2.

               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">VIII. 4.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112963:19"/>
or any of his Apoſtles do ratifie any of the Lawes of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it will be found that they <hi>containe no ſuch ratification as our adverſaries pretend in this queſtion.</hi> For they will appear not to be ſpoken by way of <hi>ſuch confirmation,</hi> without which thoſe Lawes ought to have been no longer accounted in force, which in propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſpeech is a <hi>new impoſition</hi> of them. As when a King by his Proclamation confirms his former Proclamation which was voyd by the death of his Predeceſſor, this is properly a new impoſition of the ſame things by his Authority, which after the former Kings death were not of any validity at all. We ſay, that the confirmation that the New Teſtament gives unto the Lawes of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not be found to be of this Nature, <hi>but rather teſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Lawes ſtanding in force;</hi> and ſo <hi>alledging them to confirm their own Doctrine,</hi> or to be a <hi>ground</hi> of it. As our Saviour evidently Alledges a Text out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. to ground and confirm his Doctrine againſt <hi>divorce, Mat.</hi> 19. and the Apoſtles in like manner, as we ſhall give ſome other inſtances hereafter, rather <hi>fetching their Authority</hi> (in part at leaſt) <hi>from</hi> the books of the Old Teſtament in matters of practiſe (as well as of Faith) then <hi>lending ſtrength to them</hi> by their owne Authority.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112963:19"/>
of the Caſe in generall, we muſt needs confeſſe, that as we beleeve it lies upon our Conſciences in particular, to prove any particular Law, this or that, (which we hold to be <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> or <hi>Judaicall</hi>) to be ſuch; or elſe we cannot juſtly (nor ſafely) plead it to be Repealed or Expired, if it be not named among ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in the New Teſtament: So we are afraid, that many <hi>Divines,</hi> (not to ſay ſome <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>States</hi> now adayes) have been a little too bold in rejecting ſundry Lawes as meerly <hi>Judaicall,</hi> which upon further adviſement might perhaps be found <hi>Morall</hi> and <hi>Perpetuall.</hi> To which our next Rule will ſpeak ſome what more fully.</p>

Therefore we will ſay ſomewhat at leaſt toward the clearing of both theſe, as alſo why the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> mentioned were continued <hi>then,</hi> if they be not <hi>now</hi> in force. 3. For that ſome <hi>light</hi> alſo may perhaps from hence be afforded to <hi>judge of ſome other Lawes.</hi> But all briefly, that we may not be held too long in any Digreſſion from the main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment.</p>

Yet was the reſtraint of eating thoſe things neceſſary for a while, for a double or treble <hi>ſcandall</hi> which elſe might enſue.</p>
               <p>The firſt, (and chiefly intended in this place, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.) was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> leſt they ſhould deteſt Chriſtians as favourers of Idols.</p>
               <p>A ſecond, in regard of <hi>weake Chriſtians,</hi> who not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their Liberty fully, might have judged thoſe that did eat ſuch things, unconſcionable; as alſo ſome of them be drawn to eat in like ſort, even againſt their Conſciences, by others example.</p>
               <p>A third, in regard of the <hi>Heathen Idolaters</hi> themſelves, who thereby might he hardened in their Idolatrous Worſhip, as thinking that Chriſtians did in ſome ſort allow of it, ſince they would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to eat of their Sacrifices. And in all theſe reſpects, even S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in the place before mentioned allowes the eating of ſuch things ſimply, without ſcruple of Conſcience; yet both in that Chapter (and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. though reſpecting weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) enjoynes ſtill a <hi>forbearance,</hi> ſo long as the eating might be <hi>ſcandalous</hi> to any. And now to us, this particular Law is not only
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112963:20"/>
                  <hi>repealed,</hi> as I ſaid before, but <hi>expired</hi> alſo, there being now no ſuch things among us, as any meat offered in ſacrifice to Idolls, only the generall reſpects of <hi>ſcandall,</hi> bind us ſtill, according as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may be, as thoſe places do abundantly urge.</p>
               <p>A third thing was, <hi>not eating things ſtrangled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">XIII. 3. Things ſtrangled.</note> and this was alſo <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> being ſpecially forbidden, becauſe <hi>the bloud was not powred out of it, Lev.</hi> 17.13. and the <hi>repeale</hi> of it may be clearly evidenced, not only <hi>from</hi> the former place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25, 27. Which is generall, but alſo from the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. which allowes plainly all kind of meat; yet this alſo was neceſſary to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſo long as bloud was forbidden, of which we come now in the laſt place to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing then here mentioned,<note place="margin">XIV. 4. Eating of Bloud. Repealed, as appears by foure reaſons.</note> was the <hi>not eating of Bloud,</hi> the moſt antient of all the other, being as old as <hi>Noahs</hi> age, immediately after the floud. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. and oftimes urged by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and mentioned in the Prophets with all earneſtneſſe, and ſevere threatnings, and gracious promiſes. Yet that this alſo is repealed, may appear; not only,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe bloud, having a nouriſhing quality, and being by God, in Nature, made fit for meat (as appears by experience) it comes fairly <hi>within the compaſſe of thoſe Generall ſentences, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all kinds of meat,</hi> mentioned before. But ſpecially, becauſe,</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was, at the very firſt inſtitution, a <hi>document</hi> of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing, namely, to teach them <hi>to abhorre ſhedding the Bloud of men,</hi> and accordingly it is joyned with it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. as if God had ſaid more plainly, <hi>Becauſe I will inure you, not to ſhed the bloud of men, I do forbid you to eate the bloud of any Beaſt, or Foule, or other Creature,</hi> the fleſh of which I ſhall allow you to eate: like that Law, afterward given to the Jewes. That they ſhould not <hi>muzzle the mouth of the Oxe, that treads out the corn,</hi> which (ſayes the Apoſtle) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. was written altogether for our ſakes; that the Miniſters ſhould be maintained. Seeing then the forbidding of Bloud was a part of the <hi>Pedagogy,</hi> of the <hi>Infant-Church,</hi> of the Old Teſtament, it is fairly argued, that it is now ceaſed when that Church is come to age.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe, Bloud was alſo expreſſely made <hi>a Type</hi> of the Reconciliation of Chriſt, by his Bloud ſhedding, and in that reſpect was forbidden to be eaten or drunk, God would reſerve it from common
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112963:21"/>
uſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore Chriſt being now come, and having fulfilled the <hi>Type</hi> of Reconciliation; that reſtraint ſeems to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and Liberty granted to eat Bloud now, as well as we may eat <hi>the fat</hi> or <hi>ſuet</hi> which yet was alſo forbidden to be eaten under the Law, for the very ſame reaſon, becauſe it was reſerved for ſacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.23. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whiles <hi>Bloud remained forbidden</hi> it ſeemed neceſſary to draw with it, the <hi>prohibition of things ſtrangled,</hi> as was noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Now all things ſtrangled being allowed (as was noted) bloud ſeemes to be ſo too.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112963:25"/>
Humane wiſedome to foreſee all future conveniences or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, makes all Humane Lawes mutable in themſelves: So only the emergent or ſeeming appearances of ſuch inconveniences, as were not when the Law was made, makes them be taken away actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by ſuch as are not Tyrannous nor unwiſe. Therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine (unleſſe we find it ſyllabically and undeniably expreſt) that <hi>God</hi> ſhould doe otherwiſe then perpetuate thoſe Lawes, which according to that wiſdome he hath (from Reaſon and Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) vouchſafed unto us, we cannot but judge <hi>ſubſtantially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi> for us and all men now, as well as they were for his people of old.

Yet ſtill (upon the ſame grounds of his infallible wiſdome, and never failing love to his own honour, and his Churches good) we cannot believe any ſuch Repeale, unleſſe it be undoubtedly cleare and undeniable: The rather, becauſe,—</p>

               <p>WEE have one Rule more to adde,<note place="margin">I. The third Rule, Every Law of the Decalogue is Morall.</note> to know a Law to be <hi>Morall,</hi> though but <hi>Poſitive,</hi> and that is, <hi>[Every Law of the Decalogue, or every one of the tenne Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a Morall and Perpetuall Law.]</hi> This Rule we finde, doth not paſſe currant with the contrary party, and only or principally becauſe of the <hi>fourth Commandment,</hi> which they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to honour with the title and dignity of a <hi>Morall Law;</hi> without ſome qualification or diſtinction. The others indeed they yeeld <hi>Morall,</hi> but not this, as knowing they looſe their whole cauſe, unleſſe they refuſe the <hi>fourth Commandment.</hi> We therefore, who have undertaken the ſpeciall defence of the <hi>fourth Commandment:</hi> muſt take ſpeciall paines to maintain <hi>the whole Decalogue together</hi> (and ſo that Law, as one of the tenne) <hi>to be Morall and Perpetuall,</hi> by arguments which are common to all thoſe Lawes together. Concerning which we thus proceed.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the ſtating of the Queſtion,<note place="margin">II. The queſtion ſtated.</note> we premiſe this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>That by any of thoſe Lawes being in force, we mean, that it is in force in the Words of it, according to their Litterall and Grama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112963:28"/>
ſence, and not in any myſticall or Spirituall meaning; or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the words to fly only to a generall equity,</hi> as ſome ſpeak. For both all Lawyers ſay, and reaſon it ſelf ſhewes: <hi>That a Law is no longer in force, then the Words of it are in force:</hi> at leaſt thoſe that contain the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it. And therefore to forſake the <hi>Words,</hi> and fly only to a <hi>Spirituall meaning</hi> or <hi>generall equity:</hi> is in true conſtruction,<note place="margin">As well may we ſay that the whole ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall or Iudiciall Law, is ſtill in force, as any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Decalogue whoſe words are not in force, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Spirituall meaning, or generall equity.</note> to <hi>flye from the Law,</hi> and forſake it altogether, and pronounce it Void. For the Spirituall meaning, or Generall equity, are <hi>precedent</hi> to a particular Law: and have no need of ſuch a particular Law to confirme or hold them up. For they would have been in force, though that particular Law had never been: we mean though thoſe Words (which now are ſaid to be voyd) had never been given for a Law; and are no leſſe ſtrong when that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Law is made voyd altogether. So that that <hi>particular Law is altogether made voyd, when the Words of it are rejected, as no longer obligatory,</hi> Therefore we ſay, by <hi>a Law in force</hi> we underſtand the <hi>Words</hi> of each Commandment, <hi>in their ſubſtance, and according to the Literall and Gramaticall ſence of them,</hi> which that we may evince to be true of all the Tenne Commandements, we thus argue.</p>

                  <note place="margin">III. 1. Argument. From the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of the Church in all ages.</note>Firſt, we Alledge the <hi>Teſtimony of the Church of God</hi> many wayes notified. 1.

In <hi>putting all of them, in the Words and ſyllables, into their Catechiſmes</hi> to be taught in the very Words of them, unto all Children and ignorants, (only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Idolatrous Church of Rome, hath left the 2d. wholly out of their Catechiſmes, as too groſſely contradicting their abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Image making, and Image-worſhipping.) 3. Accordingly, <hi>Expounding all of them in all Catechiſticall Sermons and Treatiſes.</hi> Though in them we confeſſe, they do diverſe of them, Forſake the Words of ſome Commandements, and particularly of the fourth too much. 4.

They
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112963:28"/>
appoint them to be all <hi>publikely repeated in the Church every Lords day.</hi> 6. Our <hi>Church of England</hi> hath gone beyond all in this,<note place="margin">This was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned while the book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayes was in uſe in the Church, and highly magnified by thoſe who are Adverſaries in this Cauſe: againſt whom it ſtill remains a convincing Argument.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, beſides all the former things, 1. <hi>A promiſe of the obſervation of them by the childe that is to be baptized, (viz.</hi> from the Sureties in the childes name.) 2.

               <p>In all which it cannot be avoyded, but it muſt be acknowledged,<note place="margin">IV. Otherwiſe guilty of a double ſin.</note> 1. That <hi>All generally agree in avouching our Rule, [That all the Decalogue is perpetuated to this day: and every one of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, in the very words of it, concerne us all as well at this day, as any people or perſons in any former age ſince it was firſt given]</hi> Or elſe they are very unwiſe in all this, to ſay the leaſt that can be. But indeed more muſt be ſaid: For hence it will follow alſo, 2. <hi>That if the whole Decalogue be not now in force,</hi> and that there be not <hi>ten</hi> Commandements now perpetual, but <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> only: and ſo if the words of any one of the ten be not now at all in force, no more then the Law of the Paſſeover, or thoſe of the other Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Feſtivals, (as ſome private men have been bold to ſpeak this kind of language) then is the Church univerſally in all Ages, and at this day in all parts of the World, undeniably and grievouſly guilty of a <hi>double ſinne:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>laying a fearfull ſtumbling block before all her children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. In laying a ſtumbling block before children.</note> 
                  <hi>in the very name of the</hi> Decalogue, <hi>or</hi> Ten Commandements, <hi>there being not ſo many now to us:</hi> And ſpecially in teaching all ignorant perſons the words of them all, and moſt of all, the words of the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Commandement, (which are ſo many and ſo plaine, for but ſix dayes work together, and then a ſeventh dayes reſt to be kept holy) which while they heare, and muſt learne, and repeat the words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; they cannot but think, but the very words bind them, and not a meere generall equity only, (or we know not what ſpirituall meaning) far remote from the words: For that they believe, that ſhould only have been taught them now, if that only had been in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:112963:29"/>
force; and they not to be troubled to learn a great many words, which doe not at all concerne them, (there being no ſuch thing to be looked to, as the words pretend commanded by <hi>God</hi>) and which are only apt to enſnare their conſciences in needleſſe ſuperſtition and ſcrupuloſitie. Therefore we muſt needs confeſſe, that though the Church of Rome be Idolatrous in making and worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet are they wiſer in their generation, and more true to their Principles, in leaving out the ſecond Commandement wholly, and never teaching it at all to their children, and common people, than thoſe Churches ſhould be (and are) that hold any one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, not now in force, according to the words of it, and yet ſtill teach them in their Catechiſmes, and cauſe their children to learne them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. In taking of Gods name in vaine.</note>But ſecondly, hence muſt alſo needs be concluded, That <hi>they are all alſo guilty of a fearfull taking GODS Name in vaine, to teach thoſe words for his Commandement, which hath not been his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement theſe</hi> 1600 <hi>yeeres:</hi> And our Church moſt of all, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all, from day to day, <hi>ask GOD forgiveneſſe for that which is no fault,</hi> (for where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion) and <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him to incline our hearts to keep this or that Law,</hi> and <hi>to write all theſe Lawes in our hearts, as His Lawes,</hi> if any of them be no longer a Law to us, nor to be kept by any neceſſity of his Divine commandement.

               <p>Theſe things we earneſtly wiſh <hi>all Diſputers,</hi> and namely of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and moſt ſpecially of <hi>our Church,</hi> ſeriouſly to weigh, and to put it home to their Conſciences, in cold blood, whether they will caſt <hi>all thoſe imputations upon the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church,</hi> and upon <hi>our own</hi> particularly: or how they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd it, if a very Heathen were to be Judge in this particular, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they grant, as we here argue, that <hi>all the Commandements of the Decalogue are ſeverally and joyntly, in their words and plain ſenſe, univerſally and perpetually Morall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">V. Why this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is firſt.</note>And this Argument we have firſt propounded, not as preferring the Teſtimony of the Church before the Scriptures, or Scripture-reaſons:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112963:29"/>
but a little to <hi>ballance the Prejudice of Diſputers,</hi> who charge us with <hi>Novelty,</hi> and <hi>Singularity,</hi> and <hi>Judaiſme,</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniſme,</hi> (any thing to make our Cauſe odious) when yet we maintain nothing in this, but what we have been trained up to by our Catechiſme, &amp;c. and neceſſitated unto by the forementioned conſiderations of the Churches recommendation of the <hi>whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,</hi> and <hi>all the words of it.</hi> And for our part, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that (beſides our Churches particular recommendation of the fourth Commandement, in the Homily of the place and time of Prayer, of which hereafter) the <hi>perpetuitie of the whole Decalogue</hi> is ſo neceſſarily involved in all theſe Acknowledgements, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and Practiſes, that we wonder where their Logick, their Reaſon, or their Divinitie and Conſcience hath been all this while, that could ſubſcribe to the Book of Common Prayer, and urge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo to it, as they have done, and yet not hold the <hi>words of the fourth Commandement perpetuall.</hi> And if we were of their opinion, we know not which way we ſhould ever dare ſo much as to <hi>read</hi> the Ten Commandements publikely, (unleſſe as a ſtory in the 20. of <hi>Exod.</hi> or 5. of <hi>Deut.</hi>) much leſſe ever teach any childe or ignorant perſon any Cathechiſme (of any of the Reformed Churches) which containes all the words of all the Commandements, (the Fourth and all) thereby to teach them any words which are now wholly out of date. And if the ſhifts our Diſputers have made to evade from the force of this Argument, doe ſatisfie their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, we ſhall rather ſtill admire then envy them. To themſelves we now leave it. Mean time we forget not the uſuall grand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>That if this be ſo, then we muſt ſtill hold to the Jewiſh ſeventh day.</hi> But that we deny for the preſent; and there is a proper place reſerved for the full ſcanning of that, to which we referre it.</p>
               <p>And ſo proceed to a ſecond Argument,<note place="margin">VI. Arg. 2. From the eminent priviledges of this Law.</note> which we thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: <hi>[Thoſe Lawes (though but Poſitive) which God in a moſt extraordinary and ſingular manner hath honoured and priviledged above all other Lawes, namely by a moſt rare and admirable delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, recording, reſerving, are Morall and Perpetuall: But ſuch are all the Lawes of the Decalogue: Ergo.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſtrengthen this Argument, we will firſt illuſtrate the <hi>Minor</hi> in the ſeverall parts of it, and then further preſſe and confirme the <hi>Major.</hi> Accordingly we propound (as we have named) three

things, as moſt rare and ſingular priviledges, wherewith <hi>God</hi> hath honoured theſe Lawes of the Decalogue, and no other.</p>

The writing of them by God himſelfe.</note>Secondly, Theſe Laws being thus pronounced &amp; given out, <hi>God</hi> in the next place takes a moſt ſingular order for the <hi>recording of them,</hi> truſts not <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf with the writing of them, but a firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time Himſelf writes them, and that upon two Tables of Stone; and the ſecond writing is more obſervable then the firſt, as more

abundantly teſtifying, that <hi>God</hi> meant to have it obſerved, that Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would write theſe Lawes, which yet He did to none elſe beſides theſe: for though he put <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>hew new Tables of ſtone,</hi> Exo. 34. (after that he had broken the firſt, in zeale and indignation againſt Iſraels idolatrie in the Golden Calfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.) yet he puts not over the <hi>writing upon the Tables</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Himſelfe, we ſay, <hi>with his own finger</hi> (as the Scripture phraſe is) did write them again, and ſo (again we ſay) He never wrote any other Lawes beſides theſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When they were thus written,<note place="margin">VIII. 3. The reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the Ark.</note> He doth not (as we may ſay) truſt any Man, or Men, with the <hi>keeping of them,</hi> but takes a moſt ſingular order to have them moſt remarkably <hi>under His own cuſtodie,</hi> His own hand or wing; for He appointed an <hi>Ark to be made, on purpoſe to keep them in,</hi> which Ark was the principall <hi>ſigne of His preſence,</hi> among that people, untill the Babyloniſh Captivity, and his <hi>prime Ordinance,</hi> and call'd his <hi>glory,</hi> his <hi>face,</hi> his <hi>ſtrength,</hi> in divers places of Scripture; and was alſo covered with the <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> or <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> which was a moſt ſingular <hi>Type of Chriſt.</hi> In this Ark were <hi>theſe Lawes kept, and no other, nor nothing elſe:</hi> as to intimate, that of all the Lawes, He took moſt care for theſe. And ſo, giving to theſe Lawes firſt (of any number of Lawes together) the Title of <hi>His Covenant,</hi> and of <hi>the Teſtimonie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.6.21.</note> (and though other Lawes afterward were taken into the Terme of <hi>His Covenant,</hi> and the Scripture mentions <hi>His Teſtimonies</hi> in the plurall, yet there was ſomewhat eminent in theſe, as being <hi>firſt ſo intituled,</hi> and ſo <hi>moſt properly</hi> thoſe termes belonged to them.)

And thus we ſuppoſe the <hi>Minor</hi> is ſufficiently confirmed.</p>
               <p>And by conſidering of all theſe together, the <hi>Major</hi> may be put out of all juſt Queſtion; in as much as <hi>it cannot</hi> (we ſuppoſe) <hi>with any reaſon be imagined, that God, intending to make ſome of his Lawes perpetuall to the worlds end, ſhould ſingle out theſe Ten from all the reſt, and give them this preheminence in all theſe reſpects, as He doth, above all others, and call them (together) again and again, the ten words, (the Decalogue) and not mean to make them, and

every one of them perpetuall:</hi> As alſo declare, that even by theſe very things, He would have <hi>them all</hi> to be taken for <hi>perpetuall,</hi> by all his people, untill the Worlds end. Each of theſe Prerogatives (ſingle) hath a great weight in it, to recommend theſe Lawes; But all of them together doe make ſuch a ſtrong chaine of obligation, and doe ſo wonderfully difference theſe from all the reſt, as that we cannot but think that any conſcience, that deſires <hi>to give God, our great Law-giver, a good account of his obedience,</hi> and holding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe bound to any of the Lawes of <hi>God,</hi> had need to produce a <hi>most certaine demonſtration,</hi> againſt any of theſe Lawes, to prove it to be <hi>repealed,</hi> if he will reckon himſelfe <hi>no longer tyed to it.</hi> We ſay, he had need have a <hi>demonſtration,</hi> not meerly againſt any <hi>circumſtance</hi> annexed to any Command, or any <hi>particularity</hi> belonging to it; but againſt the <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>formall words of it:</hi> which becauſe we have not yet met with in all our Diſputers bookes, we dare not count our ſelves looſe from the bonds of any one. And what they ſay againſt the Fourth in ſpeciall, we ſhall hereafter conſider in due place.

               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. Adding, ſecondly, a moſt gracious <hi>Promiſe</hi> to ſo many as ſhould carefully and conſcionably, by life and doctrine, honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the Commandements.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And 3. Finally, He applies all to His <hi>Hearers</hi> particularly, with ſpeciall <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the doctrines and practiſes of the Scribes and Phariſees: <hi>[For I ſay unto you, that except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſes, you ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.]</hi> The Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were outwardly exceeding ſtrict in obſerving the Letter of all the Commandements.

them in outward obedience to the very words of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; but of exceeding them in the right acknowledgement of the latitude of them, and anſwerable care even of inward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to them, (as His following Sermon expreſſeth many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars) Or elſe they muſt never look for any ſhare in the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>In a word, before we come to the Exceptions,<note place="margin">III.

               <p n="1">1. What he ſtiles the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> v. 17. He calls only the <hi>Law,</hi> v. 18. &amp; v. 19. <hi>Theſe Commandements:</hi> and v. 20.

               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, That which He calls being <hi>leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> v. 19. He calls, <hi>in no caſe entring into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> v. 20.

The <hi>Inſtances</hi> which our Saviour gives after, in his following diſcourſe, depending upon this, are all in <hi>Lawes,</hi> and not in any <hi>Predictions</hi> of the Prophets.

               <p>But we aſſume; In this place there is ſpeech only of <hi>Morall</hi> matters, and not of fulfilling things foretold or figured. Therefore by Law and Prophets, is underſtood here only the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> pertaining to this Moralitie.

If it be ſaid, <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Lawes in his owne Perſon, and ſo came not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> them in his practiſe. This indeed is moſt true, but nothing to the purpoſe, for he did come to deſtroy them by his Death and Doctrine; by himſelfe or by his Apoſtles, who (as we ſaid) did both <hi>break, deſtroy,</hi> and <hi>abrogate</hi> them, and alſo <hi>teach</hi> men ſo to doe. But take it of the <hi>Morall</hi> Law only; and he did come, not to deſtroy it, as well as to fulfill it in his owne Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, that is to confirme it, not only by his Perſonall obedience to it, but alſo by his Doctrine, as the vindication of it, from the falſe gloſſes of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> doth clearly manifeſt. Now let a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man judge, whether it is likely that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking before of the <hi>Morall</hi> Law, or meerly <hi>Morall</hi> matters, would ſo ſuddenly, without any juſt cauſe, digreſſe to ſpeake of the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Lawes, and that in ſuch a frame of words, as are, as well falſe as true.

Or that he would ſay, I came not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Ceremonials, and preſently <hi>threaten</hi> thoſe that ſhould breake one of the leaſt of thoſe Commandements, and teach men ſo; whereas the Ceremonials were ere long to be Aboliſhed

and deſtroyed. And then on the otherſide, commend and promiſe much to them, that ſhould keep them, and teach men to keep them, even thoſe Commandements which were certainly and neceſſarily to vaniſh, and paſſe away. So that this 19 <hi>verſe</hi> alone, had our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid no more, had been ſufficient to confirme the <hi>Morall</hi> Law (whereof the <hi>Decalogue</hi> is the ſumme, called often, and in eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner the tenne Commandements) to be in force to the worlds end, ſaying, <q>[Whoſoever ſhall breake one of the leaſt of theſe Commandements, and teach men ſo, ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven,]</q> 
                  <hi>&amp; contra.</hi> For we would aske of what Commandements ſpeaks our Saviour here?

other ſubſtantiall precepts, explicatorie of it, whether in <hi>Moſes,</hi> or in the Prophets. 2. If you grant (what we have proved) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> means it of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> only, or chiefly, (we now adde, If he ſpeake of it at all) you are one of thoſe, that dare to diſſolve and overthrow one of the Commandements, and teach men to breake them.

Otherwiſe the Lawes of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> and all the <hi>Ceremoniall Sabbaths,</hi> are not to this day diſſolved, nor did the Apoſtles teach men to break them.

manifeſted) but by other Commandements, though the time of the fourth Commandement, in part, and chiefly, if it may be, is to be imployed in publique worſhip. And therefore when you yield, that Chriſt ſpeaks of the Decalogue only, it is, in your interpretation, to confeſſe, that Chriſt hath made void and deſtroyed one whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Decalogue; which yet Himſelfe denies, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them that ſhall dare to doe it. You cannot avoid this, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He fulfilled in himſelf the truth of the thing figured by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sabbath, For if He deſtroyed the old Sabbath, which you ſay was the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of that Commandement, and <hi>Ceremoniall;</hi> ſtill it will follow, that He deſtroyed the <hi>Commandement,</hi> although He did fulfill the <hi>Figure.</hi> Think on it.</p>

The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by way of Recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note>And now we will draw up the <hi>ſumme</hi> of this Chapter, in a few briefe ſentences. 1. It is cleare, that Chriſt by not deſtroying the Law, means, not <hi>abrogating</hi> it, not preaching it to be void. 2. That He ſpeaks not at randome of an uncertainty of a Law, about which one might diſpute what Law He meant; but of the known Law of God, that is, the <hi>Law</hi> written, and of the words of it. 3. That He means not the whole <hi>Law</hi> written by <hi>Moſes;</hi> for a great part of that He did come to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> to abrogate and make void: And his Diſciples preached it to be void, and Himſelfe, now at this very time, doth ſo about the Law of <hi>Divorce.</hi> 4. Therefore He means it properly and undoubtedly of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> which was moſt properly called the Law; though alſo withall, of thoſe other Precepts which are ſubſtantiall and apparent <hi>explications</hi> of it, which the <hi>Prophets</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe confirmed, in their practicall Sermons, by exhortation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, promiſe, and threatning.

That it is altogether <hi>unreaſonable to imagine that God ſhould loſe any of his honour from any man ſingle, becauſe there is no other company to joyn with him</hi> in the ſolemnity of Worſhip. 2. It is alſo unreaſonable to think, <hi>that a man is not bound to ſeek the recovery of his ſoules loſt happineſſe,</hi> in his enjoying <hi>God,</hi> and converſing with Him in duties of Worſhip, to be performed both with Soule and Body, <hi>becauſe he is alone,</hi> and hath none beſides himſelfe that will have any regard to further him and themſelves together in conjoyned Worſhip. 3. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it were not abſolutely a Morall-Naturall duty to worſhip God ſolemnly</hi> (that is, with the whole man) <hi>at all.</hi> For every ſuch duty, which we by the Law of our <hi>Creation</hi> owe <hi>abſolutely</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> cannot but be <hi>perpetually poſſible</hi> and <hi>univerſally to all,</hi> He being perpetually exiſtent and preſent with us, and we with Him. But <hi>ſolemne Family-Worſhip</hi> (and much more <hi>ſolemne Publike</hi> or <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall</hi> Worſhip) is not <hi>univerſally and perpetually poſſible to all.</hi> And ſo no other ſolemne Worſhip is poſſible to them, but only <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary.</hi> And if that be not to them a <hi>Morall-Naturall duty,</hi> then none is <hi>abſolutely</hi> ſo, For it is cleare, a Chriſtian may be (and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are) forced to live many yeares in ſuch a place, among Turks or Pagans, (as a Captive, or the like) where there is no poſſibility at all of having any other to joyn with him in the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> no not ſecretly, much leſſe publikely.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:112963:49"/>
is ſo far forth Morall-Naturall, as it is Poſſible.</hi> Yet we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Private</hi> (that is, Solitary) <hi>ſolemne Worſhip is more Morall and Neceſſary,</hi> yea <hi>firſtly Morall,</hi> being not only <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> as the the other is, when it may be, but <hi>certainly Poſſible</hi> for every one of Mankinde to performe; which the other is not, at all times, and in all places, when a man will.</p>

               <p>But withall it is to be obſerved, and the obſervation will prove of much weight (as we ſhall ſee) That even <hi>indeterminate Time,</hi> to ſome buſineſſes, (and namely ſuch as admit of <hi>variety of degrees) may prove a circumſtance of much importance to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, or diſappointment of a mans end in his actions,</hi> even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> and in an <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>conſtant</hi> courſe.

               <p>Now to all this we ſay, even <hi>Indeterminate Time</hi> may in ſome reſpects be of <hi>much importance towards the furtherance or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:112963:55"/>
of his buſineſſe of Learning, according as any voluntarily (without any antecedent determination) applies himſelfe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes his Time. Namely, this is true of the two firſt reſpects of Time, the <hi>Quamdiu,</hi> or <hi>Continuance,</hi> and the <hi>Quoties,</hi> or <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie,</hi> (which are the two affections of the <hi>Quantity</hi> or Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time.)

But it is not ſo with the <hi>Quando,</hi> or <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of Beginning. For take that altogether <hi>indeterminately,</hi> and it is of no value or efficacie at all, to the ſpeeding, or putting back of Learning, that is, not in it ſelfe, though, perhaps it may be ſomewhat by <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi> A little further to explaine theſe things, will be worth our paines: and ſo we will conſider each of theſe reſpects ſeverally, as alſo joyn the two firſt together, as far as they agree in this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in hand.</p>
               <p>Here then, 1. we affirm, that [the <hi>Quamdiu,</hi> or <hi>continuance of Time,</hi>

So that a man may both foretell of two Students of equall capacitie, (and opportunity of helps) that he who hath beſtowed, even altogether <hi>voluntarily,</hi> and without any <hi>antecedent determination,</hi> a <hi>longer Time,</hi> ſuch Day, upon Learning, hath gotten <hi>more</hi> that Day, then the other that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed <hi>leſſe</hi> Time.

When his <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>bodily</hi> ſpirit may be more <hi>fit,</hi> or <hi>unfit,</hi> by beginning ſooner, or later, at this houre, or that. 2.

When the <hi>delay,</hi> or <hi>haſtening</hi> the beginning to ſtudy, fals in with, or croſſes the other reſpects of Time foreſpoken of, (which are in themſelves of importance) as when a man thereby ſhall have liberty and opportunity, or not, to <hi>continue longer,</hi> or <hi>reiterate oftener</hi> his ſtudy, and the advantages of getting Learning. But all theſe are accidentall things, and not conſtant to ſuch <hi>ſeaſons of Time;</hi> wherein <hi>indeterminately</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> ſtudy may be begun, or a Student may repaire to his Tutour, or the like.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſetting aſide ſuch Accidentall Conſiderations, It will, we ſay, appeare, that in the <hi>Quando,</hi> or <hi>beginning of Time,</hi> (according to any <hi>denomination</hi> of Nature, as this or that Day; or of Art, this or that Houre, as we ſpake before) <hi>there is no materiality at all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the advantage, or diſadvantage</hi> of Learning. One part of <hi>Time</hi> (according to which, every moment, a new <hi>Quando</hi> begins, wherein a man, if he pleaſe, may begin to ſtudy) is as behovefull as another, one Minute as another, one Houre as another, one Day as another, and none more then another. So that here a man can neither rationally <hi>foretell,</hi> nor <hi>conclude</hi> any thing, (as he might in the former reſpects) <hi>what Progreſſe,</hi> much or little, a man hath made: Nor 2. whether <hi>more or leſſe, compared with another,</hi> who begun at another ſeaſon, ſooner or later: Not yet 3. <hi>what Affection</hi> he hath to Learning; For a man may ſometimes begin to ſtudy in the Morning early, meerly by having nothing elſe to buſie himſelfe in at that ſeaſon; and he may forbeare to begin, not for want of affection, but through interruptions of other buſineſſe: Nor 4. by ſeeing any ones progreſſe in Learning, can it be judged (unleſſe from ſome accidentall thing withall) <hi>what Day or Houre he began</hi> to ſtudy; or which Houre or Day he took for ſtudy, out of any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, if he intermitted any.

                  <hi>the Quando, or Seaſon of beginning</hi> (at this or that particular Time) <hi>indeterminately, and voluntarily</hi> (without reſpect to ſome accident that may fall in with it) <hi>is a thing meerly indifferent, and no matter of wiſedome, or importance at all</hi> toward Learning, or any other like buſineſſe.</p>

                  <hi>and each of them requires intention of mind to a right performance of it,</hi> as it is evidently with the buſineſſe of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as hath been noted; <hi>And that withall there are divers other buſineſſes of importance, which muſt have alſo</hi> frequently <hi>their juſt ſpaces allotted to them: There, of the two, it is more</hi> profitable <hi>in both conſiderations,</hi> (of promoting Learning, and ſerving others occaſions and buſineſſes) <hi>to have the determination weigh moſt upon the ſide of the</hi> Continuance, <hi>and make that as large as may be, with ſome competent</hi> Frequencie, <hi>rather then to make the Returne more</hi> frequent, <hi>with a remarkably</hi> ſhorter Continuance.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Common Time is that which attends actions.</note>This diſtinction, is in part the ſame with that formerly layd downe of <hi>indeterminate,</hi> and determinate <hi>Time.</hi> For all <hi>indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Time is <hi>Common Time,</hi> and meerly an <hi>attendant upon Duties</hi> of Worſhip. And all <hi>Solewne Time, which requires Duties of Worſhip to attend it,</hi> is <hi>determinate</hi> Time, namely <hi>antecedently</hi> determined by God, (in Nature, or in His Word) or by ſome Superiour among men, or by a mans owne reſolution or vow.</p>
               <p>But now in Religion, ſome kind of <hi>determinate</hi> Time, comes <hi>more properly</hi> under the notion of <hi>Common</hi> Time, then of <hi>Solemne</hi> Time. And ſo neither are <hi>indeterminate and common Time,</hi> termes altogether reciprocall, and convertible; Nor yet <hi>determinate and ſolemne Time.</hi> For ſome <hi>determinate</hi> Time, ſuch namely as is in any reſpect determined <hi>by the nature of any Dutie</hi> of Religion, viz. of the Worſhip of God, is <hi>as meerly an attendant upon</hi> the <hi>Dutie,</hi> as any <hi>indeterminate</hi> Time, being according to the deſcription of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate Time, <hi>a meere circumſtance;</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not in any <hi>Theologicall</hi> Conſideration, but <hi>meerly Phyſicall</hi> and Naturall, it being <hi>ſimply impoſſible in nature</hi> to performe thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without ſuch concomitance &amp; <hi>attendance</hi> of Time. As the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> of Time for the reading of a Chapter, or of ſuch a Liturgy,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:112963:64"/>
or the like, is plainly <hi>determined by the Nature of the Action, and Phyſically neceſſary</hi> to the Action, and ſo no more but <hi>common</hi> Time. So that by <hi>common</hi> Time, we underſtand both all <hi>indeterminate</hi> Time, voluntarily and uncertainly applyed to Duties of Religion, as alſo whatſoever Time <hi>the nature of any Dutie</hi> of Religion doth of it ſelfe <hi>determine</hi> in any reſpect. And by <hi>ſolemne</hi> Time, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, only ſuch <hi>determinate</hi> Time, as is either by God, or Man, (a Superiour, or ones ſelfe) <hi>Antecedently determined,</hi> either for <hi>any one Dutie</hi> of Religion or Worſhip in ſpeciall, or generally for <hi>any Duties</hi> of Religion whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This being thus laid downe, it followes;<note place="margin">II. This falls not properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Law.</note> 
                  <hi>That Time in the firſt Conſideration,</hi> of indeterminate and common <hi>Time, cannot properly be ſaid to fall under the Law of God,</hi> or that any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of His ſhould at all medle with it. As well becauſe, 1. It is no leſſe then <hi>ridiculous</hi> to make a Law, or even give a ſingle command about that which whether we will or no, will be ſure to accompany our actions. The Law in this, takes order only for the <hi>action,</hi> this or that Dutie to be performed; and that carries <hi>Time</hi> (ſuch indeterminate and common Time,) along with it, infallibly and unavoidably. As alſo. 2. for that the Command of God (or even of Man) being the efficient cauſe of the determination of <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne</hi> Time, it is a formall contradiction to ſay, <hi>[That any Precept or Law Commands any Time, altogether indeterminate.]</hi> For as ſoone as it medles with it, it makes it determinate, (and ſolemne) it determines it, in one reſpect or other, at leaſt remiſſely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a latitude: As when we bid a man, <hi>take Time to Pray, or reade in the Scriptures, or meditate of the Sermon he hath heard, or learne a Catechiſme;</hi> or any ſuch like thing, though without any ſeeming <hi>determination of the Time</hi> in any reſpect: It is yet certainly in true conſtruction of the phraſe, an <hi>implicite determination</hi> of <hi>ſome Time,</hi> at leaſt of the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>beginning</hi> both, within ſome lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: or elſe ſuch command of <hi>taking Time</hi> is altogether frivolous and idle. In that (as hath beene ſaid) it abundantly ſuffices to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Dutie;</hi> and then <hi>Time</hi> (ſuch indeterminate and common Time) will be ſure to attend it. And this will appeare, if the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be but put, <hi>why one did bid, take Time.</hi> The anſwer muſt be, Either <hi>becauſe the thing will require</hi> ſome remarkable Continuance: Or that <hi>a man is not forward</hi> to begin to ſet about it, or the like;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:112963:65"/>
To remedy which, ſuch command is given, <hi>bidding a man determine ſome Time to himſelfe</hi> for ſuch an action. And ſpecially their whole aime in their diſcourſes, is to have the <hi>Continuance</hi> to be wholly left to the <hi>Churches determination,</hi> as a meere appendix to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Worſhip.</p>

                  <note place="margin">III. Yet this ſeemes all our Adverſaries grant Morall in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>3. All this notwithſtanding, it may perhaps be queſtioned by him that ſhall adviſedly read our adverſaries books, <hi>Whether they ſetledly grant any more then ſuch indeterminate (or common) Time,</hi> to be the <hi>Morality of the fourth Commandement?</hi> Namely, That, <hi>it being Morall-Naturall</hi> (as they ſpeake) <hi>to have a Publike Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> It is alſo, conſequently, <hi>to have a Time for it.</hi> But they admit not, <hi>that the Law of Nature</hi> (or the fourth Commandement Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) <hi>doth command any determinate Time in any reſpect:</hi> any <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Continuance,</hi> or <hi>determinate revolution,</hi> or <hi>determinate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of Time; but leaves all (they ſay) to the Church to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what it pleaſes. Now this, ſo farre as we can underſtand, is to command <hi>nothing of Time</hi> at all; having before proved, that <hi>ſuch Time,</hi> (indeterminate and common) falls not at all under a Law properly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">IV.

But then againe it other Times, they ſeeme quite to fall off from all, while they ſpeake only of <hi>a neceſſary ſequell of a Morality,</hi> and make Place <hi>altogether equall in Religion with Time;</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> to be a <hi>meere adjunct</hi> and <hi>circumſtance,</hi>

                  <hi>wholly left to the Church,</hi> and to be no <hi>otherwiſe due to the Worſhip of God, then to all other Things.</hi> And what can this be more then <hi>indeterminate</hi> and <hi>common Time</hi> meerely? Which belongs no more to the fourth Commandement, (or even to the firſt Table,) then it doth to the fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the whole ſecond Table, for the affirmative part of it.

                  <hi>determined only by their command;</hi> and ſo for all other Superiours. <hi>Such Time</hi> then is the Morality of the fifth Commandement, as much as of the fourth: But indeed of neither; being only a <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally neceſſary attendant</hi> of every Dutie to God or Man. And the obeying of Superiours, determining any ſuch <hi>Time</hi> for ſuch <hi>Dutie,</hi> comes under that Commandement, which requires <hi>obedience unto Superiours;</hi> which is the fifth Commandement: Though the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> it ſelfe to be performed, belong to the firſt Table, as being a <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</hi> But of this more hereafter, only we hold it neceſſary, here to give a touch to this, which is perhaps one of the <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall miſtakes</hi> in this queſtion.

thoſe two <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and <hi>the ſouls good,</hi> it is neceſſary often to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member throughout this whole Controverſie; the rather becauſe our Adverſaries ſeem much to forget it in their books, making very little and ſeldome mention of the <hi>Souls good</hi> in all this Queſtion) Now we ſay, <hi>both theſe buſineſſes together,</hi> may be, &amp; are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>forwarded</hi> or <hi>kept back,</hi> according to a mans voluntary <hi>lengthning out,</hi> or <hi>ſhortning</hi> the <hi>Continuance</hi> of his attendance upon God; where it is left free, and his ſpirits are able to hold out, &amp; ſo by the <hi>frequent</hi> Reiteration or <hi>ſeldomenes,</hi> where there is no <hi>juſt impediment.</hi> He who ſo gives God <hi>longeſt</hi> and <hi>ofteneſt</hi> Time, unqueſtionably <hi>honours Him moſt</hi> in his heart, &amp; encreaſes in it: And he <hi>leſſe,</hi> that beſtowes a <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> &amp; <hi>ſeldomer</hi> Time upon Gods worſhip, of his own accord meerly.</p>
               <p>And this is yet more evident with Relation to the <hi>ſoules good;</hi> which conſiſting: 1. In <hi>knowledge</hi> of matters of Religion: 2. In <hi>Memory</hi> of them: 3.

Alſo, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing an Equality of Ability, and Bleſſing:) a man may judge <hi>who beſtowes moſt and oftneſt Time</hi> upon Religion, by the <hi>increaſe</hi> in <hi>knowledge and Piety:</hi> And who is <hi>wiſeſt for his ſoule,</hi> and will make beſt progreſſe in Piety by obſerving the <hi>Continuance and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency</hi> of Time Voluntarily beſtowed upon God and his Worſhip. So that theſe two reſpects of <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Quamdiu</hi> or <hi>Continuance,</hi> and the <hi>Quoties</hi> or <hi>Frequencie,</hi> are in themſelves, and in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

even <hi>Indeterminately</hi> and <hi>Voluntarily applied,</hi> very <hi>Materiall</hi> (and, as we may ſay, <hi>Subſtantiall</hi>) circumſtances to Religion, as we ſaid before for learning and ſuch like Civill buſineſſes (And much more then, if <hi>wiſely</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtrongly Determined,</hi> as we ſhal ſee afterward)</p>
               <p>But ſo is not the <hi>Quando,</hi> or <hi>ſeaſon of beginning,</hi>

He may have more or leſſe help toward any duty of worſhip: Or 3.

That he ſhall gaine or loſe altogether an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of performing ſome particular Duty of Solemne worſhip to God. Such like accidents, may commend or diſcommend poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the haſt or delay, of beginning to Worſhip God at any Seaſon voluntarily; but elſe in it ſelfe, the <hi>Quando,</hi> or Seaſon of beginning, <hi>indeterminately,</hi> is of no <hi>importance</hi> to the glory of God, or the good of Soules. Neither yet is it any <hi>proofe</hi> of a mans affection or diſaffection to Religion, or any Duty of Gods Worſhip. For a man may begin it at this or that Seaſon, either out of willingneſſe to take in hand the Duty, or out of willingneſſe to be ſoon rid of the Duty: And he may defer it out of fear of interruption, and that he may be freer and fitter for it after a while: Or out of unwillingneſſe to performe the Duty at all. Of which our unhappy Experience af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords every man too many inſtances, even in his own heart. So that this difference (formerly noted in Civill actions) between the <hi>Quando,</hi> the Seaſon of beginning, and the other two reſpects, the <hi>Quamdin</hi> or Continuance, and the <hi>Quoties</hi> or Frequency, is alſo clear in Religion, <hi>That theſe</hi> (even Indeterminate) <hi>are of maine importance</hi> and very materiall Circumſtances in their Application: and the <hi>other is of no Validity in it ſelfe,</hi> toward Religion and Gods Worſhip; which Notion we ſhall anon make juſt uſe of more then once, in convenient place.</p>

Of which ſort God inſtituted divers under the Old Teſtament undeniably: and we ſay he did alſo <hi>one</hi> ſuch Day under the New Teſtament the firſt Day of the weeke, (cald therefore <hi>the Lords Day</hi>) in ſtead of the Old Seventh Day-Sabbath; which was in <hi>memory</hi> of <hi>Chriſts reſt from the worke of redemption,</hi> as the former of <hi>Gods reſt from the worke of Creation.</hi> And men alſo both under the Old and New Teſtament have inſtituted ſome particular dayes in <hi>memoriall</hi> of Gods workes, as upon ſuch dayes: as the <hi>dayes of purim</hi> in the booke of <hi>Eſter,</hi> and the <hi>feaſt of the dedication,</hi> mentioned <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.22. and inſtituted in the Time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> as we read, 1. <hi>Mac.</hi> 4.59. And, no man doubts but the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> hath inſtituted divers ſuch <hi>dayes of memoriall:</hi> Our Adverſaries affirming it, even of the <hi>Lords Day</hi> it ſelfe, But that we ſhall diſpute with them about in due ſeaſon. Now for the <hi>profit</hi> of theſe <hi>inſtitutions,</hi> ſo farre, and ſo long as God commanded (or commands yet) any; there is, no doubt, ſome profit in that: by a ſpirituall bleſſing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon that day above another, not commanded by him. All his <hi>Ordinances</hi> being ever accompanied with a bleſſing unto, and upon the right obſervers of them; and accordingly at the very firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Seventh Day Sabbath,</hi> God is ſaid to <hi>bleſſe</hi> it, as well as to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> it: Nay <hi>firſt</hi> to bleſſe it, then to ſanctifie it, (though it was doubtles the ſame act) as of purpoſe to ſecure the <hi>bleſſing</hi> to the <hi>obſervers</hi> of its <hi>ſanctification. (Gen.</hi> 2.3.) And withall it may ſerve in a degree, to quicken, not the memory only, but the <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> alſo toward God for ſuch a benefit, as the Worlds Creation, and ſo for the other benefits, of which ſome other dayes were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>memorialls.</hi> Gods command, certainly, make theſe <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> lively and operative for theſe purpoſes, ſo long as he would have them to be ſo uſed.</p>

for inſtance, a whole Dayes Continuance.) <hi>notwithſtanding thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</hi> We ſay then (again) <hi>that excepting thoſe caſes, the largeſt determination of Continuance, is Profitable, and more Profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably then a leſſe Continuance would, or could be.</hi> The illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this will be of uſe; and therefore we thus further expreſſe it, by a Generall Argument.

But this we leave the Diſcuſsion of to a following Chapter, where we ſhall endeavour to beat it out clearly, and at large.

The heart would often <hi>not be brought in frame, till a great part of the Duty,</hi> and perhaps <hi>of the whole Time</hi> for the various Duties, <hi>were over-paſt and gone.</hi> And another while, <hi>that which was gotten</hi> of knowledge or Affection, would <hi>ſtraightway be loſt</hi> again, by <hi>Diverting the minde</hi> ſuddainly unto worldly Cogitations: As is more then evident unto the conſciences of Chriſtians, when after a Sermon heard on the weeke day, at the Market; they do (whether Neceſſarily or Voluntarily) immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately lay aſide the thoughts of it, and engage themſelves in worldly buſineſſes. In ſuch caſes, it is a very, very little Profit, that their ſouls make by ſuch attendance upon God (though for an hour or more together, and with the beſt help of the publike Miniſtery:) unleſſe the matter did very much ſute with their preſent affections, and ſo ſinkes more then ordinarily deep into them; Or that they ſpecially call themſelves to a ſerious account, the next free hour they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:112963:76"/>
have, to ſettle it upon their minds and conſciences by meditation and Prayer: And this they have often no leiſure for on the week dayes, till they have even forgotten the moſt of what they had heard. But now in the <hi>Continuance</hi> of a <hi>whole Day,</hi> they have not only <hi>leiſure,</hi> but in a manner a <hi>Neceſſity of laying to heart,</hi> what ſpecially they have learned in the publike Miniſterie. For all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſſes, diſcourſes, or even cogitations, being then unſeaſonable and unlawfull; they have now no manner of excuſe, if they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate not, of what ſpecially may and doth concerne their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and of which they have been that day inſtructed and put in minde. And if they live among any that regard God at all, they may have help from them (for remembrance and affection both) by conference of what they have heard, even at meals: beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Times. Neither can they have any diſcourſe ſo proper as of that uſually, nothing of the world being then allowed (ordinarily) as was touched before. A great deale more might be ſaid to evidence the ſingular profit of having the <hi>Continuance</hi> with the <hi>largeſt</hi> that may be. But we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of it again in the next Chapter, and ſo we forbear to amplifie things now. Only we muſt not forget to note, that if we ſhall take <hi>our Adverſaries proportion</hi> upon the Lords Day, namely three or four hours, (which is about that proportion, which the practiſe of our Church generally allots for the publike worſhip) though we remember not, that they any where vouchſafe to name ſuch a <hi>Proportion</hi> di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

For this Proportion of three or four hours in a weeke, is but about two hours of a Day, if divided between two dayes: and if between three dayes, about an hour and a quarter: If between four dayes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hour in a day: If between five dayes not an hour for each day. If between ſix dayes, not three quarters of an hour for each, and if between 7. dayes, about half an hour for every day. Here now, whereas the whole <hi>three or four hours</hi> would afford ſome <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, Profit</hi> if all upon <hi>one day,</hi> and ſo make it <hi>one Continuance</hi> (admitting them alſo a <hi>Reſervation</hi> for going home to dinner) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

there would be ſome convenient roome for the varieties of publike duties (though none at all, according to their account, for the private) and ſo it might worke ſomewhat upon them: yet if it came to be <hi>leſſened</hi> by <hi>diviſion into more dayes,</hi> and ſo more Frequent Revolutions: There would be either an <hi>excluſion</hi> of Prayer, or Reading, or Singing, or Preaching, or Catechiſing one or other of them (not to name the Sacraments, which are not uſually every week, but Baptiſme only occaſionally, and the Lords Supper ſeldome oftner then once a moneth in any Church) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> would ſo far forth prejudice the good that might have been gotten, by that which is ſo omitted; Or elſe very <hi>much ſcanty</hi> each of them, and ſo weaken the good to be received by every one of them ſingly, and jointly.</p>

Bur theſe alſo, (which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable note) are only <hi>Determination of the</hi> Quando, Seaſon, or Order of Time. And no ſuch (that we can remember) are found Excluſive, even for particular occaſions of Worſhip, either for the <hi>Frequencie,</hi> (unleſſe ſuch, as were only once in a yeere to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as the Paſſeover, and ſuch like feaſts of memoriall of particular benefits: or once in a life, as Circumciſion of old was, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is now held to be) or much leſſe for the <hi>Continuance,</hi> it being never forbidden (to ſay no more now) to give God the <hi>longeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> at any Time, when any <hi>Continuance</hi> at all was determined.

               <p>All which we note, as well to <hi>prevent the miſtake</hi> of any <hi>unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Conſcience,</hi> who, ſpecially by the ſuggeſtion of others, might
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:112963:79"/>
fancie perhaps the fourth Commandement injoyning one Day of ſeven for Religion, to be an <hi>Excluſive Determination;</hi> and that it were forbidden to imploy any other Time (conſiderably) upon Gods worſhip, or looking after their ſoules; as alſo (and that chiefly) to <hi>confute</hi> the untowardneſſe of ſome <hi>profane Cavillers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Objection prevented.</note> who though they are far enough from obſerving the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequencie</hi> Religiouſly of <hi>one Day in ſeven,</hi> according to the fourth Commandement; yet dogmatically and moſt perverſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that if that Commandement be in force for one Day in ſeven for Religion, then it is alſo for ſix Dayes working and following worldly buſineſſe, equally neceſſarily: And that ſo it is equally a ſin to goe to heare a Sermon on a Week-Day, as to work upon the Sabbath; and that the fourth Commandement forbids the one, as well as the other. Now this were to make the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an <hi>Excluſive</hi> Determination. The contrary whereunto may ſufficiently appeare from what hath been already ſaid. Yet for more complete conviction (and perfect rooting out any ſuch ſcruple in the minds of any that are not wilfull) we adde, <hi>[That it is moſt evident, That God never meant the fourth Commandement for an Excluſive Determination]</hi> nor was it ever ſo, no not to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (and therefore neither can it be ſo to us now) as both Gods other determinations, and Mens alſo, even ſtrictly, beſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe ones, doth undeniably manifeſt. For we finde in Scripture, that not only before the fourth Commandement (given with the reſt, in that <hi>Majeſticke</hi> manner on Mount Sinai,) the <hi>Feaſt of the Paſſeover,</hi> and herein two Dayes, the firſt and the laſt of unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bread, were determined by God himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> He beſides determined the <hi>Feaſt of Weekes,</hi> and that of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> (this againe having two Dayes, the firſt, and the laſt as <hi>Sabbaths</hi>) and the Dayes of the <hi>New Moones,</hi> every moneth, and the Day of <hi>Attonement,</hi> yeerly, and dayly alſo (every Day) a double Frequencie of Time, for the <hi>Morning and Evening Sacrifice.</hi> All much Times, were indeed ſpecially inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for <hi>particular reaſons,</hi> (except the dayly Frequencie of the Morning and Evening Oblation) and had to the Jewes, <hi>Typicall relations,</hi> each of them, in the particularities of their ſeaſons, and the manner of their obſervations: Yet alſo were all thoſe <hi>Solemne Dayes</hi> ſerviceable likewiſe to the <hi>Generall buſineſſe of Religion,</hi> for

increaſe of <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God and <hi>Affection</hi> toward Him, (though in no proportion, comparable with the <hi>Weekely Sabbath,</hi> by reaſon of their Rarity and its Frequencie) as appeares both in <hi>reaſon,</hi> and by the <hi>Shunamites</hi> uſing to goe to the Prophet upon the New Moones. By all which it is moſt undoubted, that <hi>God meant not the determination of the Weekely</hi> Sabbath, <hi>for an Excluſive determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time for the Generall of Religion.</hi> As alſo by that Holy Men did yet further <hi>determine Times, for themſelves</hi> (as David, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel <hi>three Times</hi> every Day for Prayer) and for others too, as the <hi>Dayes of Purim,</hi> and the <hi>Feaſt of Dedication</hi> forenoted, and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Dayes of Faſts,</hi> upon extraordinary occaſions: Beſides all <hi>voluntary Times,</hi> imployed by pious ſoules, every where inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. Likewiſe the Generall Precepts of <hi>[Praying continually,</hi> and <hi>without ceaſing]</hi> (and many ſuch like, formerly mentioned, and others to be named anon) doe certainly imply, that men ought to beſtow more Time upon Religion, Gods ſolemne Worſhip, and their own, and others ſoules, (as they can redeeme opportunity,) then God hath expreſly determined, theſe being <hi>remiſſe determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (as we ſhall ſhew by and by, together with the reaſon of them.) There is then no ſuch thing as an <hi>Excluſive determination</hi> to be fancied with relation to the <hi>Generall of Religion;</hi> as being <hi>expreſly contrary</hi> to all the <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> of it in Scripture, and the Church in all ages. Only we grant, (and deſire it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred) that no man may determine (either for himſelfe, or much leſſe, for others) Time in any of the reſpects, So as 1. to <hi>March for Holineſſe and Neceſſitie,</hi> with Gods determined Times; which is the fault of the <hi>Popiſh Holy-dayes,</hi> all of them, beſides the Idolatry ef ſome of them, being ſpecially intended to the honour of Creatures, Angels, and Saints, the bleſſed Virgin, and others.

                  <note place="margin">I. Determinate Time is, 1.

Now we are to proceed to a higher ſtep concerning it: Namely the <hi>Neceſſity of its Determination</hi> for Religion, Gods honour and the good of mens ſoules, of which though we have alſo ſpoken ſomewhat in generall already: Yet are there further conſiderations to be ſet down about it; and particularly, <hi>[What kind of Determination, of any one of the reſpects of Time ſingle, or of any two of them jointly, or of all three of them together, is neceſſary for Religion?</hi> As alſo, <hi>what manner of Determination, Remiſſe, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiall, or Concluſive?]</hi> according to what may be proved from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rules</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>light of nature,</hi> Applyable to <hi>all men</hi> in <hi>all ages, all the world over:</hi> and <hi>generall rules</hi> alſo of <hi>Scripture,</hi> without allegation of the fourth Commandement, or any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination expreſt in Scripture.

of our tenents generally, reſerving the diſcuſſion of particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and objections, to the following parts, where we ſhal deale with the ſeveralls in their order diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>To begin then,<note place="margin">II. 1 Explained.</note> we propound two Poſitions in the forefront of this diſcourſe about the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Determinate Time</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (according to the Title of this Chapter,) whereof the firſt is <hi>[Some Determinate ſolemne Time for Gods Worſhip is Morall Naturall.]</hi> This we muſt firſt <hi>Explaine,</hi> and then we ſhall ſet upon the <hi>proofe</hi> of it. For explication, we deſire it may be obſerved. 1.<note place="margin">1. Meant onely of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and Frequency.</note> That <hi>We affirme it onely in regard of the</hi> quantity <hi>or</hi> Proportion <hi>of time:</hi> but yet of that, in <hi>both the reſpects of it, the</hi> Quamdiu <hi>or Continuance,</hi> and the Quoties <hi>or Frequency:</hi> That ſome Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſolemne <hi>Continuance</hi> is <hi>Morall Naturall;</hi> and again, ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſolemne <hi>Frequency,</hi> is commanded, by the very <hi>Law of nature;</hi> namely, (according to our former deſcription of the law of nature <hi>c.</hi> 1.) <hi>[That every reaſonable man, notwithſtanding the preſent corruption of his nature, may be forced to acknowledge it neceſſary to be given to God in duties of His immediate and ſolemne worſhip, in regard of the importance of thoſe reſpects of time for Religion, Gods Honour and the good of mens ſoules: And that accordingly, duties muſt attend thoſe Determinations of Time to fill up the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and anſwer the revolutions.]</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>conſequence</hi> of this argument is undeniably confirmed, by thoſe ſentences of the Apoſtle; that <hi>whoſoever ſins, tranſgreſſes the law, for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law;</hi> and <hi>where no law is, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> So that if to give God <hi>never above halfe a minute at once,</hi> in waiting upon him in any ſolemne worſhip, be a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and <hi>ſinne,</hi> even againſt the <hi>law of nature,</hi> then the <hi>law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Determines a ſolemne Time, <hi>at leaſt ſomewhat above that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potion</hi> of Continuance; and ſo a whole minute, or three quarters of a minute (or the like) is a Determinate ſolemne Time by the law of

nature, and morall naturall: or any other proportion of continuance that can be named, or imagined ſmaller then this, will ſerve to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate and confirme this conſequence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is no leſſe certaine, and cleare, what ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the moſt corrupted man be called to judge, (if he wholly deny not a God, and a worſhip due to him) for all men cannot but confeſſe, that it were ſin <hi>never</hi> throughout a mans <hi>whole life</hi> to give God above <hi>halfe a minute at once,</hi> or a <hi>quarter</hi> of a minute, or any leſſe proportion of continuance, if leſſe can be mentioned or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: (As for inſtance, that of the Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. when he <hi>ſmote his breaſt, and cried, Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi> this was a <hi>ſolemne Worſhip,</hi> and continued a little longer then an inſtant, and ſo was meaſurable for Continuance, but never to give God a <hi>larger Continuance,</hi> cannot but be acknowledged a ſinne.) <hi>Ergo,</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is firme, that <hi>ſome Determinate ſolemne Time above that proportion of Continuance, is Morall-Naturall, and determined even by the law of nature.</hi>

               <p>And this which we have now aſſerted, conſidered by it ſelfe, we conceive that every one (even our very Adverſaries) will, and muſt grant us.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:112963:89"/>
as we hope, ſufficiently ſatisfie them: And then ſo many as dare not directly <hi>take away the fourth Commandement wholly,</hi> will be forced to yield it <hi>in force</hi> (as we contend) for <hi>one Day in ſeven,</hi> even from <hi>this</hi> very Argument, beſides all others.

For their ſakes it is, and for other conſcientious Chriſtians, who count themſelves bound to cleave to the <hi>whole Decalogue,</hi> (for the Reaſons before alleadged in the 2. 3. 4. and 5.

within 24 houres, to be <hi>ſuch a Day, as the Law of Nature deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines for Gods worſhip:</hi> Then, whether it determine only one ſuch Day in a mans life, or more, (of which we yet diſpute not, but ſhall doe anon) <hi>It determines not equally to ſeverall men,</hi> but to ſome a <hi>longer Continuance,</hi> to ſome a <hi>ſhorter:</hi> becauſe all doe not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wake a <hi>like Continuance;</hi> but ſome more, ſome leſſe, according to the naturall abilities and tempers of their bodily ſpirits; ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſatisfied, without they have more ſleep then others ſtand in need of: And that it <hi>ſeems an inconvenience,</hi> to ſay, <hi>That the Law of Nature doth not bind all men equally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XXIII. Anſw. 1.</note>To this we anſwer briefly, 1. That it is <hi>no inconvenience</hi> to ſay, <hi>That the Law of Nature, in one ſenſe, equally binds all men; and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſenſe, it doth not bind all men equally: [aeque, non aequaliter,</hi> as we ſpake before in another matter:] <hi>and that about the ſelfe-ſame thing.</hi> Namely, that it may bind all men to <hi>the ſame proportion, Geometricall,</hi> as the ſchooles ſpeake; but not to <hi>the ſame proportion Arithmeticall.</hi> As for example, <hi>the Law of Nature, binds all rich men equally,</hi> in one ſenſe, <hi>to releeve the poore:</hi> But in another ſenſe, it binds them <hi>not all equally.</hi> It equally binds them all, in a <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall proportion,</hi> that is, according as they are able to ſpare, and others need: But it binds them not all equally, in (or to) an <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall proportion,</hi> that is, juſt ſo many pounds, ſhillings, or pence; becauſe all have not alike to ſpare. So in this caſe, the <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equally binds</hi> all men to give God <hi>a Day,</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch as Day as they are able,</hi> ſuch a Day as their Naturall ſpirits can hold out unto; as they are able to continue waking, in the ſervice of God: But it doth not bind all then <hi>equally to the ſame proportions of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,</hi> becauſe all are not able to wake equally, one as long as an other. But ſo farre as men are able, it binds all equally, all being bound to ſerve God in the Day with all their ſtrength, the ſtrength of all their Naturall abilities. And <hi>ſo much,</hi> we ſhall preſently ſee, <hi>The Law of Nature, commands every one of mankind;</hi> (and more then ſo much, it doth not command;) <hi>whether the Continuance be longer or ſhorter, compared with others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">XXIV. Anſw. 2.</note>2. But with all we ſay, <hi>If any one of mankind, through neglect of the ſervice of God or miſſe-devotion to it, doe willingly ſleepe more, and wake leſſe Time then he need to doe:</hi> (whether, againe, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, compared with other men, be longer or ſhorter,) <hi>he is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:112963:92"/>
and will be found a tranſgreſſour againſt this Law of Nature:</hi> For this is but <hi>corruption</hi> in him, though perhaps he may pretend <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall infirmity.</hi> But of that, and all other ſuch like pretences, this Rule, in a word, may be a certaine and ſufficient judge, <hi>That what Continuance ſoever a man is able to keep himſelfe waking in a Day, about any worldly buſineſſe, or matter of pleaſure</hi> (gaming or the like,) <hi>he is able to keepe himſelfe, according to Nature, the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Time in the ſervice of God,</hi> in one or other exerciſe of Religion, which Naturally weary not the ſpirits, more then world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters; but rather leſſe then many worldly matters; and the varieties may refreſh and doe greatly, the mind, ſo farre as carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and corruption overſway not. And therefore, in the firſt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this poſition concerning <hi>a Day</hi> to be determined by the Law of Nature, we diſtinguiſht, <hi>Naturall abilities,</hi> from <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For we take it for a moſt undeniable Truth, <hi>That corruption doth not hinder the Law of Nature from commanding to the utmoſt of Naturall abilities,</hi> (as long at leaſt as it exceeds not them,) For the <hi>loving</hi> and ſo <hi>ſerving,</hi> God <hi>withall our ſtrength</hi> (as was toucht before) is infallibly of the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> and yet no mans <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> now ſuffers him to yeeld God ſo much love and ſervice. This alſo made be made good in manifold particular inſtances, <hi>That the Law of Nature doth command us to doe things, which now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Our corruption it is impoſſible for any man to doe.</hi> As to pray, or read, or hear the Word, (when ever he doth any of theſe Duties,) with a ſteady fixed heart and mind, without any diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or worldly thoughts at all, that while (for that they are, ſo farre forth, a <hi>taking of Gods holy name in vaine,</hi>) Yet this no man is able now to doe, as all mens conſciences will confeſſe, even though they imploy but a very ſhort Continuance in it.</p>
               <p>And now we come to <hi>prove,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">XXV. An argument to prove that nature deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines a dayes continuance.</note> that <hi>a Dayes Continuance for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is determined by the Law of Nature,</hi> from grounds and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>in Nature</hi> which we have formerly made uſe of. <hi>[If it be ſin againſt the Law of Nature, never in a mans life to give God a whole Day at once; then the Law of Nature determines to every man, a whole Dayes Continuance, once at leaſt in his life,</hi> But it is ſinne againſt the Law of Nature never to God a whole Day at once. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.] The conſequence is</hi> undeniable. The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is thus further made good. <hi>[That which is contrary to the acknowledgement of Gods
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:112963:93"/>
being the Lord of us and all our Time, and Gods being our happineſſe, is a ſinne againſt the Law of Nature. But never in a mans life to give God, a whole Day at once,</hi> is contrary to thoſe acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Ergo.]</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is moſt plaine and certaine, The <hi>Minor</hi> alſo may be infallibly proved. Becauſe thoſe <hi>acknowledgments call for as much Continuance at once, as Nature can poſſibly determine and poſſibly give at once, where all that a man hath is due, that debt cannot be ſatisfied, unleſſe all be tendred to Him.</hi> So unleſſe all the Continuance of a Day be tendred to God, he hath not all that is due to Him as Lord of all our Time. Alſo where a man acknowledges his <hi>whole happineſſe</hi> to lie, that cannot but carry him, with the <hi>whole of his ſtrength,</hi> to the <hi>utmoſt Continuance</hi> Nature hath to give: For all that a man doth is toward his <hi>happineſſe;</hi> and nothing can draw his mind from it, while his acknowledgement of it failes not. Now we have already ſhewed, that Nature can and doth determine <hi>ſuch a Day to every man for buſineſſe</hi> (of what kind ſoever,) and that it can give it wholly to God, imploy it wholly in the ſervice of God (taking in ſpecially, the <hi>Reſervations</hi> of any <hi>neceſſary refreſhings,</hi> which Nature, and not corruption calling for God allowes, and any extraordinary other <hi>Neceſſary interruption,</hi> as we have formerly ſaid.) Therefore, <hi>never throughout a mans life to give God that which Nature, is ſo able to give Him,</hi> is againſt <hi>thoſe acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods Soveraignty and His being our Happineſſe,</hi> and ſo <hi>a ſinne</hi> againſt the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XXVI. An objection anſwered.</note>If here it be objected, <hi>That the ſame Argument will as well prove the whole Continuance of every Day of our life, as of one Day:</hi> which yet it doth not doe, nor cannot; becauſe our <hi>Naturall</hi> neceſſities, <hi>allowed by God,</hi> and even <hi>commanded by the Law of Nature,</hi> (as it concernes the ſecond Table duties) admits it not. And therefore the Argument is either falſe, or impertinent, or both.</p>
               <p>We anſwer, that the Objection furniſhes us with ſufficient ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of the Arguments both <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>pertinencie.</hi> For we grant, according to the Objection, <hi>that God, in the Law of Nature, commands to attend neceſſary Worldly buſineſſes, as well</hi> (we ſay not, <hi>as much,</hi> that is, as abſolutely neceſſarily) <hi>as His ſervices, and the purſuing immediately of the Soules happineſſe, in and by them</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> it is not true, that the Argument proves the <hi>whole of every Dayes continuance</hi> to be determined by the <hi>Law
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:112963:93"/>
of Nature,</hi> for Religion, and Gods immediate worſhip. Although, <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> it proves of <hi>every particular Day,</hi> (that is, this or that <hi>Quando</hi>) as well as of <hi>one.</hi> But we propound it not of any particular Day, in reſpect of the <hi>Quando</hi> or Seaſon, this or that Day; but only of <hi>one ſingle Continuance of a Day.</hi> And ſo it is both true, and pertinent. It is <hi>true:</hi> For though <hi>naturall neceſſities</hi> of Worldly buſineſſes will not admit the <hi>whole Continuance of every Day,</hi> one after another, (that is, the <hi>Quoties</hi> or <hi>Revolution</hi> joyned to the <hi>Continuance,</hi> which we meddle not with in the Argument) Yet they will certainly admit <hi>one Day in a mans life:</hi> we mean, ordinary buſineſſes will, (and for extraordinary neceſſities, we grant, as before, Reſervation for them, if they ſhould fall out, when a man were upon that <hi>one Dayes</hi> devotions.) Therefore ſtill Nature can give <hi>ſuch a Day;</hi> and therefore again we ſay, It is true, that the <hi>Law of Nature doth determine it.</hi> And as for the <hi>pertinencie</hi> of this Diſcourſe, we ſhall ſhew it by and by.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Objection may be made; Namely,<note place="margin">XXVII. Another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>That what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by the Law of Nature, is alwayes, and certainly ſo:</hi> But <hi>ſo is not this: becauſe, for any thing the light of Nature can ſee, or ſay, God may have declared, that He will not have a whole Day, at any time, at once:</hi> and then the Argument will overthrow it ſelfe; <hi>He being the Soveraigne Lord of in and all our Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this we anſwer two things. 1. That we have in part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prevented this Objection; becauſe, before we propounded this Queſtion, of our judging of the <hi>Law of Natures determining a Continuance of Time concluſively</hi> for Religion, we propounded it <hi>under the favour of Gods allowance of it,</hi> even becauſe <hi>all Time is His,</hi> and <hi>He hath no need of any ſervice of ours.</hi> Therefore the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is intended but ſo far forth, as God hath <hi>not refuſed</hi> a whole Dayes continuance at once to be tendred to Him in Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. 2. We adde, that unleſſe we had ſuch an <hi>expreſſe refuſall in Scripture,</hi> we cannot conceive how the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> can <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſuch thing,</hi> as, that God ſhould <hi>not allow</hi> His creatures <hi>to attend upon Him ſo long together at once, as their naturall abilities are able to doe,</hi> and their <hi>ordinary worldly neceſſities</hi> (with the allowed <hi>reſervations</hi>) do certainly admit: That it can ſtand, we ſay, with His <hi>Honour,</hi> to <hi>refuſe and forbid a whole Day.</hi> The rather, becauſe none of our Adverſaries, notwithſtanding their diſpleaſure

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XXVIII. A third obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>One Objection yet remaines, <hi>That two halfe Dayes may doe as well as one whole Day,</hi> as being <hi>the ſame proportion in the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We anſwer divers things: 1. We ſuppoſe we have already in the former Chapter proved, That the <hi>longeſt Continuance</hi> is more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Religion, as alſo more convenient for leaving freedome for worldly buſineſſes at other times, then to <hi>divide the proportion</hi> of ſo many houres between divers Dayes. 2. For any man <hi>unnceceſſarily to break off the continuance</hi> of his attendance upon Gods ſolemne Worſhip, is undeniably to <hi>diſcover want of Devotion</hi> to the Service of his Lord, and want of affection to God, his happineſſe. If a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> take him off, for a little while, or for longer, the <hi>Reſervation</hi> (which we have oft named) acquits him of <hi>ſinne;</hi> but it may, and ſhould be a griefe to him: Elſe Chriſt would not have bidden His Diſciples, [<hi>Pray that your flight be not on the Sabbath,</hi> Mat. 24.20.] Implying, it ought to <hi>grieve</hi> them, though it were <hi>lawfull:</hi> (of which place we ſhall ſpeak fully in due time.) But therefore we ſay again, To break off unneceſſarily, when a man hath free liberty to attend on God, is a ſinne. 3. Beſides that, <hi>He knowes not whether he may not be hindred to morrow, or when he would make up his other halfe Day, and ſo loſe it altogether;</hi> or be ſo long put off from Day to Day, till a great deale of his Affections gotten or quickned in the former halfe Day, be quenched again and loſt. A carefull Tenant, when his Rent is due, and he hath it all ready, will not bring halfe, and leave the reſt to another time, leſt he be robbed in the mean while, or be forced to ſpend it, and ſo want it when he ſhould pay it. If a man be bound to give God the proportion of a <hi>whole Day,</hi> as this Objection grants; and that by unneceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, he ſhould die, having tendred but <hi>one halfe Day,</hi> when he might have given the whole, he dies in a ſinne. Therefore for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:112963:94"/>
                  <hi>two halfe Dayes are not ſo good as a whole Day.</hi> 4. If after that one <hi>whole Day,</hi> a man can certainly have freedome for another <hi>halfe Day,</hi> (we adde, or even for another whole Day) the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will again hold for <hi>that halfe Day</hi> alſo, or that ſecond whole Day, and ſo will adde ſuch a <hi>Frequencie</hi> to the <hi>Continuance.</hi> But this were loſt, we mean the benefit of the ſecond halfe Day, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an unneceſſary breaking off at the former halfe Dayes end, (or not beginning till halfe were gone) this ſecond muſt goe to make up the former proportion of a whole Day: whereas here had been halfe a Day clearly gained to Religion, if the former Day had been wholly obſerved. Therefore we conclude, that notwithſtanding all theſe Objections, [<hi>A whole Dayes continuance, at leaſt once in every mans life, is determined to him for Religious attendance upon God,</hi> in that ſort that hath been diſcourſed.] Other Arguments there are, which will helpe to evince the ſame, as we ſuppoſe.

no conſideration of Gods (not only <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> but) <hi>command,</hi> to imploy our ſelves in worldly callings, and performe ſuch worldly buſineſſes as are neceſſary accordingly; can be pretended to be a <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient diſcharge,</hi> abſolutely, and alwayes.

every ſix or five, or four, or three, or each other day; or half, or more of every day: But indeed none of all this <hi>certainly or concluſively;</hi> becauſe (as we ſaid) <hi>the light of Nature can in no wiſe Determine,</hi> how much is ſufficient for Religion, or how much worldly neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can poſsibly admit.

Becauſe they are not conſtant to them, but in ſtead of this they as often make the <hi>Morality</hi> to be <hi>only Publike Worſhip,</hi> (which they only call <hi>Solemne Worſhip</hi>) and then the Time is required only by <hi>conſequence,</hi> and as a <hi>ſequell of a Morality,</hi> wherein <hi>Place</hi> is as much Morall, as Time; and accordingly ſo they uſually Aſſert <hi>Time and Place to be equall circumſtances in Religion:</hi> And yet they do not uſually ſpeak out, concerning <hi>Place [That a ſet, ſtinted, regulated place ſhould be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall-Naturall.]</hi> And much leſſe do they, or indeed can they ſay any thing of the <hi>Sufficiency of Place</hi> toward Religion, as of <hi>Time</hi> they do and muſt.

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> needs little proofe to any conſcience, For as <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neceſſary to all men,</hi> So muſt needs be the <hi>meanes and helps, without which it cannot ſtand among all men.</hi> The <hi>meanes</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> ſo farre as they are conjoyned, are <hi>equally neceſſary</hi> in <hi>Naturall</hi> and <hi>Theologicall</hi> reaſon.

               <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> before we offer to <hi>prove</hi> it, we crave leave to <hi>explain</hi> and cleare two expreſsions in it.

and meanes, and helpes of Religion. 2. By the phraſe, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men,</hi> we meane, that the <hi>greateſt part of mankind</hi> cannot maintaine Religion in their ſoules, without ſuch a <hi>determination</hi> of a <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> for it; ſuch namely, as have a <hi>conſtant and full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in a worldly calling,</hi> whether inferiors (ſpecially) or even ſuperiours and Governours of families, or of Townes, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Commonwealths: Religion cannot (<hi>Certainly,</hi> that is, <hi>Ordinarily</hi>) ſtand among them, who are farre the greateſt part of minkind, without a <hi>ſufficient Time determined</hi> and <hi>conſcionably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi> Though we grant, that among ſome of mankind, who have <hi>no great buſineſſe in worldly imployments,</hi> but have leiſure much, even every Day, ordinarily, to beſtow divers houres upon Religion, Gods Worſhip and their ſoules good, and to Frequent the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Worſhip</hi> where ever it is neer them: <hi>Such</hi> might perhaps keepe up Religion in their conſciences, though they were not under (or did not know themſelves to be under) any ſuch <hi>determination</hi> of a <hi>ſufficient Time neceſſary</hi> to be obſerved for Religion.

But this by the way, and in a kind of digreſſion, not unuſefull, we hope. And ſo having cleared our meaning in the <hi>Minor</hi> of our <hi>Argument,</hi> we come to prove it, Namely, <hi>[That without a Chiefe Time determined ſufficiently for Solemn Worſhip, Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all men.]</hi> Thus we further argue:</p>

                  <hi>[If without a ſufficient Time determined, both for Continuance,</hi>

                  <hi>and Frequencie jointly, no ſufficient Time will be generally obſerved among Mankind, for Religion: Then, without ſuch a Time determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all Mankind. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a ſufficient Time determined, no ſufficient Time will be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obſerved.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Without ſuch a ſufficient Time determined, Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all Mankind.]</hi> The <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of this Argument may be undeniably made good, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that <hi>without a ſufficient Time obſerved for Religion, Men who are borne void of the knowledge of God, and unapt enough to learne it, will never attaine a ſufficiencie of knowledge</hi> for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of God in their hearts and lives, and ſaving their own ſouls: Nor is it imaginable, that they can poſſibly come to ſuch <hi>knowledge,</hi> either by the <hi>Continuance</hi> of <hi>one whole Day once in their lives,</hi> (of which we diſputed before) or by the addition of a <hi>few Minutes, twice, or thrice, or four times every Day,</hi> by ſnatches and ſudden fits. Mans nature is too froward, too much corrupted, to learn the myſtery of heaven and ſalvation ſo by the by; as experience ſuperabundantly proclaimes, even where there is a great deale more Time then ſo allotted to it, and obſerved for it. Alſo, 2. without ſuch a <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> obſerved for Religion, The great duty of <hi>love to God,</hi> which is the <hi>fundamentall affection,</hi> and even the <hi>ſumme of all Piety,</hi> can never, in an ordinary courſe, be attained, or preſerved, or exerciſed and expreſt. Men are as averſe from <hi>Gods love,</hi> as ignorant in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:112963:103"/>
                  <hi>knowledge</hi> of Him: And even though they have a knowledge of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of God, (as many have, not only competently, but even eminently, by having been trained up to it, and having ſpent much time upon it, from their youth up) yet they may be <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>affection,</hi> and wholly devoid of all <hi>love to God.</hi> And there is no ordinary meanes to work their hearts to ſuch a holy <hi>love,</hi> but by their being <hi>buſied</hi> a convenient <hi>ſpace of Time,</hi> and that <hi>frequently,</hi> in the <hi>ſervices</hi> of God, hearing of Him, and meditating of Him, and the like; whereby they may come to be convinced of the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of thoſe divine truths which they have learned to know, and ſee a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>imbracing</hi> them, and God in them, above all. <hi>Acquaintance breeds love, between thoſe that were ſtrangers:</hi> So doth <hi>acquaintance with God,</hi> by the obſervation of <hi>ſufficient convenient times</hi> of <hi>attendance</hi> upon His Ordinances. Alſo, if in any, ſome <hi>beginning of love and affection</hi> be bred, there is no <hi>preſerving</hi> of it from <hi>decay,</hi> but by <hi>frequent and conveniently continued intercourſes</hi> and converſes in holy duties. Any man, that diſuſes theſe, or curtals the Times of them, will, and doth find in himſelfe, (if he conſider himſelfe at all) a ſenſible <hi>coldneſſe,</hi> and a <hi>ſtrangeneſſe</hi> grow upon him, to the utter endangering of all the love of God in his ſoule, which in the mean time the World in generall, and particular Creatures, which have encroached upon his Times, have ſtollen alſo away even <hi>all the love from God;</hi> which can never be <hi>regained,</hi> unleſſe by renewing (even with enlargement oftentimes) the former <hi>Continuances</hi> and <hi>Frequencies</hi> of Times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for Religion and Devotion. Withall there is not any ſo kindly or proper an expreſſion or exerciſe of <hi>love to God</hi> any other way, as this of obſerving convenient Times of <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequencie</hi> in <hi>ſpirituall converſes</hi> with Him. <hi>Love,</hi> where there is not a violent detention from the object, or party loved, admits not a <hi>forbearance of attendance long,</hi> neither can it content it ſelfe with <hi>ſudden ſnatches;</hi> a word or two, and away; a ſecret whiſper, and no more: But though it is glad of theſe <hi>occaſionally,</hi> and, as it were, by way of <hi>overplus</hi> to ſolemn converſes; yet cannot be <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> upon thoſe termes; but muſt, and will obſerve juſt <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,</hi> and thoſe <hi>frequently,</hi> ſo as to make up a <hi>convenient ſufficiencie of Times;</hi> and where this is not, <hi>there is no generall and ordinary way for men to exerciſe and expreſſe any love to God:</hi> But the <hi>love,</hi> and

all the main <hi>exerciſe</hi> and <hi>expreſſions</hi> of it, will goe away after the World, pleaſures, friends, honours, riches, as they that wallow up <hi>all the Time,</hi> in a manner. And upon this, the VVorld is ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally and perpetually a reall Comment, that it is needleſſe to diſcourſe further of it.

                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:112963:104"/>[1. <hi>If Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all men, without a convenient ſpace of Continuance frequently obſerved in publique VVorſhip: then a ſufficient Time muſt neceſſarily be determined for all men, wherein they both may and muſt exerciſe themſelves in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique VVorſhip.</hi> But Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all men without a convenient ſpace of Continuance frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Publique Worſhip. <hi>Ergo,</hi> A ſufficient Time muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be determined for all men, wherein they both may, and muſt exerciſe themſelves in Publique Worſhip.] For the clearing of this argument: By the words, <hi>Certainly,</hi> and <hi>among all men,</hi> we underſtand as before, <hi>Ordinarily,</hi> according to Gods uſuall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>all ſorts:</hi> and not as things may be by his extraordinary grace to ſome that can have no help from any publique ordinances, nor as ſome extraordinary perſons may ſhift without them. Alſo by <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique VVorſhip,</hi> we underſtand, not that which is preſented onely in a publique <hi>place,</hi> as in <hi>Churches,</hi> where there is publique and free liberty to ſerve God, without feare or danger of perſecution: But ſuch Worſhip as is tendred by an <hi>Aſſembly of Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe families,</hi> wherein ſome <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Miniſters</hi> of God are imployed between God and His People, to diſpenſe to them His Word and Sacraments, and preſent to Him their Prayers and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: in whatſoever place this be, in a Church, a private houſe, a field, a wood, a cave, a ſhip, or the like: So that the terme of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> relates to the <hi>perſons,</hi> and not to the <hi>place,</hi> in this argument. The <hi>Conſequence</hi> of which, is, we ſuppoſe, ſufficiently confirmed before in the generall argument, in the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of uſing all <hi>ordained</hi> and <hi>poſſible</hi> meanes of advancing and preſerving <hi>Religion</hi> among all men; and the neceſſity of ſuch a <hi>Determination</hi> of ſuch Times, as are neceſſary to be obſerved; by reaſon of mens <hi>unwillingneſſe,</hi> and <hi>interruptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecndent</hi> may certainly be evinced, by Gods frequent and earneſt charges to His Miniſters to <hi>preach His VVord, and be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon:</hi> and to His people, to <hi>aſſemble themſelves together, not forſaking the practice of it,</hi> (as the manner of ſome was) and to be <hi>ſwift to heare,</hi> and <hi>not to deſpiſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying;</hi> telling them, that <hi>Faith is begotten</hi> (ordinarily) not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>hearing,</hi> and that of a <hi>Preacher ſent of God,</hi> for ſuch publike ſervice; and that <hi>they are bleſt, that wait at the gates of VViſdoms

But the neceſſity of this is yet more cleare, from the conſideration of the <hi>good of mens ſoules,</hi> which doe extremely ſtand in need of it. In the moſt families all the world over, the abilities of <hi>private</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (even of governours of families) are not ſuch, as will ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſuffice to build up themſelves and their families in the faith and feare of God, without the help of a <hi>conſtant publike Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</hi> And by reaſon of their manifold worldly imployments and buſineſſes, they have not leiſure to apply themſelves much and often to ſtudy the Scriptures, and matters of Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, no not for themſelves ſufficiently, and much leſſe for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and ſo cannot but be ignorant of many things, and miſtake and miſ-underſtand many others even of ſpeciall importance for Gods <hi>honour,</hi> and their own and others <hi>ſalvation;</hi> which againe calls for as neceſſary, their attendance upon a <hi>Publike Miniſtery,</hi> whoſe gifts and ſtudies are diſtilled for their benefit, and whoſe Sermons cleare truths, and urge practice of duties, and avoidance of ſins; and preſent comforts to them, with much more evidence and ſtrength of Divine reaſon, then they could of themſelves have lighted upon, or by any <hi>private helpe</hi> uſually have attained unto. And this hath been ſo <hi>univerſally acknowledged</hi> by all Chriſtians, in all Ages and Countries, that where there hath been any number of them neer one another, they have had their <hi>Church-Aſſemblies,</hi> or <hi>Publike VVorſhip,</hi> though forced to be in <hi>private houſes,</hi> and even in fields, and woods, and caves; and to obſerve the times in the nights, or in the morning before day, to avoid the rage of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutours, as much as might be: and yet chuſing rather to <hi>hazard</hi> the expoſing their <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>bodily ſubſtance</hi> to their fury, if they were ſurprized, (as ſometimes they were) then to neglect ſuch a <hi>joint ſerving</hi> of God, and hazard their <hi>ſoules</hi> for want of ſuch <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ordinances</hi> and meanes of Grace. Adde hereunto the contrary
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:112963:105"/>
experience in our Kingdome and Nation; that where any, (as too many in divers places) whether poore or rich, ſervants or others, upon any conſiderations whatſoever, doe uſually <hi>neglect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like aſſemblies,</hi> and ſo come to no Church, nor publike Ordinances ordinarily, they are either <hi>groſſely ignorant,</hi> or <hi>profane,</hi> or both: in a word, at the beſt, but <hi>civill Atheiſts,</hi> devoid of any true ſenſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> or regard of God, or their ſoules. And ſo we ſuppoſe the firſt branch concerning Publike Worſhip, is ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, <hi>That the ordinary ſolemne Time for all men muſt extend to that, and determine a convenient Continuance for that:</hi> But not for that alone, but for domeſtique and family-worſhip alſo;</p>
               <p>Which is our ſecond branch, now to be confirmed,<note place="margin">XLVI. 2 To Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Worſhip.</note> 
                  <hi>That the ſufficient Time muſt be of ſo large Continuance, as to extend alſo to that, and require men that live in Families where they have others to joyne with them in the VVorſhip, to tender ſuch conjoyned VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> (beſides the <hi>Publike) in their ſeverall Families reſpectively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove this, we reſume againe our former Argument in this manner.</p>
               <p>[<hi>If Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all men, without a convenient ſpace of Continuance frequently obſerved for Family Worſhip, over and above the Publike Worſhip, Then the chiefe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Time of Worſhip is not ſufficiently determined for all men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Continuance of it, be ſo largely extented, as to require Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Worſhip over and above the publike.</hi> But Religion cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſtand among all men, without a convenient ſpace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance frequently obſerved for Family Worſhip, over above the Publike. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The chiefe Solemne Time of Worſhip, is not ſufficiently determined for all men, unleſſe the Continuance be ſo largely extended as to require Family Worſhip, over and above the Publike.] The <hi>Conſequence</hi> of this Argument is partly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before; There needs only this to be added for the clearing of the Neceſſity of the <hi>Determination</hi> of <hi>ſuch Time,</hi> to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it: That otherwiſe, 1. Men and Women of <hi>other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, would interrupt</hi> thoſe that were willing to tender ſuch <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Worſhip,</hi> oftentimes by viſits of reſpect and complement, and by coming to diſcourſe with them about worldly buſineſſes, bargaines, newes, or any thing; and they ſhould not be able to avoyd their importunities many times: only a tie of a <hi>determinate
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:112963:106"/>
Time</hi> upon all ſorts, may and will ſuffice to keepe or ſend away ſuch <hi>unneceſſary interruptours</hi> of Religious Services. 2. <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> or Prophane <hi>Governours</hi> would elſe <hi>never looke after their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies at all,</hi> but let them worke or play, yea make them <hi>Worke,</hi> after the Publike Worſhip ended; Who yet may be <hi>awed</hi> to the contrary (as much as to any other Duty) by a certaine and cleare <hi>determination of Time</hi> to be imployed in <hi>Family Worſhip,</hi> as well as <hi>Publike.</hi> 3. <hi>Prophane Servants</hi> and inferiours will not be brought into order, to <hi>joyne in Family Duties,</hi> unleſſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Time determined</hi> to them for it, at leaſt, by their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. That <hi>Family Worſhip</hi> then may be obſerved, there muſt be <hi>Sufficient Time determined for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> may be made good, partly by what wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. about <hi>Family VVorſhip in Genenall,</hi> the <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of it, for Gods Honour and the Good of Soules; and partly by the adding of a foure-fold Conſideration briefely applyed to the caſe in hand. 1. Experience ſhewes, that <hi>in moſt Families, their worldly buſineſſes are ſo many</hi> and preſſing, that they have, (and can have) but ſhort and ſcanty Times of Continuance on the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary working Dayes, for their <hi>joynt Family VVorſhip:</hi> Many pretend they cannot have any at all, for all their Families, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially not twice a Day, according to what was diſcourſed before. Though this is but a worldly pretence, if it be meant ordinarily; and will hardly we doubt ſerve for an excuſe, when God ſhall come to judge men for their worldly mindedneſſe, as well as others ſinnes, and preferring the World, getting goods, and following pleaſures and the like, before converſing with Him, and their own ſoules, and the ſoules of their Families. But however, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, that ordinarily ſuch Times can be but <hi>ſcanty and ſhort.</hi> Therefore there is the more need that upon the <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time,</hi> the extent of the <hi>Continuance</hi> be ſufficient to afford a convenient ſpace for <hi>Family VVorſhip</hi> over and above the <hi>Publike;</hi> and to take away all excuſe of <hi>want of leiſure</hi> from every one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>need</hi> that all ſtand in <hi>to have their minds prepared, and put into frame for the Publike VVorſhip,</hi> calls for the ſame alſo. If men come rawly and rudely from worldly thoughts and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, into the Church and to the Publike Worſhip, they will be in a great deale of danger to take Gods Name in vaine in it, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:112963:106"/>
at the beginning, and to loſe a remarkable part of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, by the <hi>unpreparedneſſe</hi> of their minds; ſpecially ſuch as are of leſſe knowledge and leſſe affection towards godlineſſe. And this cannot in reaſon be prevented any way ſo ſurely, as by ſome <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Duties</hi> preparing every one for the <hi>Publike,</hi> and taking them off from <hi>worldlineſſe</hi> and ſecular cogitations, and poſſeſſing them with an <hi>awe of the Duties</hi> they are going to performe more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No leſſe, but rather much more, the <hi>improvement of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like VVorſhip neceſſarily calls for conſequent Family VVorſhip;</hi> for <hi>memory</hi> and further <hi>affecting</hi> of every one, by <hi>Repetitions,</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Conferences.</hi> Every one hath needs of this, the beſt memories and the moſt zealous hearts, how much more the weake in both reſpects; and if any be able and zealous, it is ſo much the more a neceſſary Duty in them to helpe others as much as may be. This alſo (we meane particularly <hi>repetitions</hi>) will <hi>quicken the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> of all ſorts. Neither the ſervants, nor yet the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, will afford themſelves leiſure to <hi>ſleepe,</hi> or <hi>gaze,</hi> or muſe of other matters during the <hi>Publike VVorſhip;</hi> if the one muſt give account, and the other muſt be able to require it and take it, which he cannot, if he himſelfe have not given good attention.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Finally, the <hi>need</hi> that moſt have <hi>to labour with their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to put more knowledge in them,</hi> then they have particular helpe for in the <hi>Publike Services</hi> of the Day: I meane the need of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall catechiſing</hi> of them, (even beyond what is publikely done to thoſe of their Family) makes up yet further the neceſſity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and obſerving ſufficient Times for Family Duties of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, beſides the publike, how long (or how well) ſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
               <p>And all this, is ſo confirmed by the unhappy <hi>experience</hi> of thoſe <hi>Families, where this is not regarded,</hi> not obſerved, that conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is more neceſſary, then a prolixe diſcourſe upon it. He that lookes adviſedly upon ſuch Families, ſhall ſee them come <hi>drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in,</hi> one after another, late to the <hi>Publike Worſhip;</hi> and when they are there, <hi>ſleepe</hi> oftentimes, even in the morning, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe behave themſelves ſo <hi>rudely,</hi> as a man may be aſſured, they neither <hi>honour God,</hi> nor <hi>benefit their Soules</hi> by ſuch ſervices; And after, even though they ſeemed to be attentive and obſervant, they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:112963:107"/>
have learned little or nothing at all; oftentimes have forgotten the very Texts, and the Chapters or Pſalmes that were read, and can tell nothing at all of what they might have learned; and if they could remember ſomewhat for the preſent, yet it is for want of whetting (as the originall word is <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. in the charge given to Govenours of Families toward their children, and ſo ſervants) for want of giving or <hi>taking account</hi> of it, for want of <hi>repetition and conference,</hi> all is loſt, or moſt of it, and ſpecially all <hi>affection is dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> and abated, which had a little edge perhaps by the Publike Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: And this moſt of all, through the diverſions of their minds as ſoone as the Publike Ordinances are ended, to <hi>ſports and play,</hi> or to worldly worke and buſineſſe; which muſt needs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, with the moſt, if they be not <hi>determined to Family Duties</hi> afterward. In a word, looke upon ſuch Families, where the Lords Day is not obſerved by them within doores, in ſuch divine exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of devotions before, and ſpecially after, the Publike Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and there will be found in the moſt <hi>very little ſence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> of <hi>conſcience toward God,</hi> or their <hi>owne Soules.</hi> So that we conclude this branch alſo, <hi>[That in as much as Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all men without Family VVorſhip, the chiefe ſolemne ſufficient Time, muſt extend among all men to Family VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over and above the publike, affording ſpace for it, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that it be ſo imployed.]</hi> But this is not all yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XLVII. 3. To ſolitary worſhip.</note>The third branch muſt be added, which concernes <hi>Solitary Worſhip,</hi> over and above both the other: The <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> we ſay, <hi>muſt extend to that</hi> alſo, beſides the <hi>conjoyned worſhip,</hi> publique, domeſticall. To confirme this, our former argument will once more ſtand in ſtead, in this ſort.</p>
               <p>[<hi>If Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all man, without a convenient ſpace of Continuance frequently obſerved for Solitary Worſhip by a mans ſelf alone, over and above conjoyned Worſhip with others, then the chiefe ſolemne Time of Worſhip muſt neceſſarily be determined ſo largely for the Continuance, as that it may extend to Solitary Worſhip, beſides conjoyned Worſhip.</hi> But Religion cannot certainly ſtand among all men, without a convenient ſpace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance frequently obſerved for Solitary Worſhip by a mans ſelf alone, over and above conjoyned Worſhip with others. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The chiefe Solemne Time of Worſhip muſt neceſſarily be determined

ſo largely for the continuance, as that it may extend to Solitary Worſhip, beſides conjoyned.] The <hi>Conſequence</hi> of this argument, hath ſtrength afforded it from the former confirmations of like Conſequences. Yet may it admit this further deſcant, upon the <hi>neceſſity of the Times being determined,</hi> that it may be infallibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: Namely, <hi>that here there is need of the moſt peremptory deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all other:</hi> as well, 1. to prevent all <hi>unneceſſary interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which yet, without this, every man is exceedingly lyable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and that from all ſorts of perſons, Superiours, Inferiours, Equals, within doores, and from abroad: they are liable to offer many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions and interpoſe many hindrances, with their hands and even with their tongues, unleſſe both be charmed by a ſufficient determination: and every man and woman is liable to admit ſuch interruptions, unneceſſarily from others, unleſſe they be themſelves <hi>forbidden</hi> by the <hi>tye of ſuch a Determination</hi> lying upon them, which even they may be able to <hi>pleade</hi> againſt the over-preſſing <hi>importunity</hi> of ſuch <hi>Interruptors.</hi> 2. Alſo to ſecure the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch neceſſary <hi>Solitary Worſhip,</hi> againſt the <hi>generall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe</hi> that is in mens hearts againſt it of all other duties. And this nothing can poſsibly ſecure, but a <hi>peremptory Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> awing the conſcience, becauſe of the <hi>ſecrecy of the duty,</hi> which no man is or can be witneſſe to conſtantly, nor take ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an account of; there muſt be therefore neceſſarily, a <hi>ſtrict De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination</hi> of Time for ſuch <hi>Solitary VVorſhip;</hi> or elſe infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly there will be none ſuch conſtantly obſerved by the <hi>generallity</hi> of men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent,</hi> That <hi>there is a neceſſity of a frequent obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a convenient Continuance for ſolitary VVorſhip,</hi> is proved not only from what was ſaid of its being <hi>Morall-Naturall,</hi> Chap. 6. but by what was even now argued to evince the neceſſity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Family VVorſhip</hi> applyed to this; As 1. <hi>That experience</hi> ſhewes, <hi>moſt men,</hi> ſpecially of the inferiour ſort, ſervants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the poore that are faine <hi>to worke hard for their livings;</hi> and even ſuperiours, if men of trade and well cuſtomed, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if perſons of buſineſſe, All ſuch have but <hi>little leiſure on the working Dayes</hi> for any <hi>ſolemne ſolitary Worſhip.</hi> And upon that pretence, we doubt not, but divers Readers have been already grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we have ſeemed a while agoe to urge them to at leaſt,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:112963:108"/>
twice every Day, (though <hi>Daniel was a man of buſineſſe enough, and yet he kept himſelfe conſtantly to his three times a Day,</hi> and ſo did David too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.) Therefore there is unqueſtionably the more neede, that the <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time,</hi> ſhould <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently determine a juſt ſpace</hi> for this <hi>ſolitary</hi> Worſhip (beſides <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) to ſupply ſomewhat thoſe defects and take away all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of want of leiſure, from every one. Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> in the place before cited <q>[To ſupply the defects of daily meditation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calvin in</hi> Gen. 2.</note> every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day was peculiarly choſen of God.]</q> 2. A <hi>ſolitary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is needfull, both <hi>for the Family Worſhip,</hi> and for the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Worſhip;</hi> and without this, neither are like to be reverently performed, or improved. <hi>A mans owne mind, is the only comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it ſelfe, and if it neglect it ſelfe by it ſelfe, others conjoyned helpes will worke little upon it.</hi> 3. But ſpecially <hi>after the Publike, or Family Worſhip,</hi> or both (and ſo betweene whiles, if there be ſpace betweene,) The <hi>improvement of the other,</hi> mainly, if not wholly, <hi>depends upon the ſolitary Worſhip</hi> a man (or woman) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents alone; in <hi>recalling,</hi> and <hi>working upon their owne ſoules,</hi> what they have been converſant in with others; by <hi>ſolitary Meditations</hi> and <hi>Prayers.</hi> No tongue or hand of another can reach their heart to apply home the neceſſary truths. Neither is it any time ſo <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently</hi> done with <hi>others ſpeaking,</hi> or even with <hi>ones owne ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from God,</hi> or to <hi>God</hi> in conjoyned prayers (although ſo, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, a <hi>good beginning</hi> is made) but ſtill there wants a <hi>further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> to more inward and particular caſes, and more matters, a further preaching over (repeating over) to ones owne heart the Doctrines of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practiſe,</hi> and a further <hi>praying</hi> them over, out of ones owne inmoſt and ſecret thoughts powred forth before God. I adde, <hi>the more fully any one is affected by the Publike</hi> (or other conjoyned) <hi>Ordinances, the more they are (and will be) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to carry thoſe thoughts alone into the preſence of God, and beg of Him to write and imprint them yet more firmely upon their hearts.</hi> So farre is the <hi>Publike Worſhip</hi> from <hi>diſcharging</hi> a man from <hi>ſolitary Worſhip,</hi> that we dare be bold to ſay (and appeale to all experienced conſciences for the truth of it) that <hi>[That man, or woman, never throughly profited by that VVord read or preached, or other Ordinance of God in Publike, (or in a Family) which they did not care to thinke of by themſelves alone, with the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:112963:108"/>
firſt free leiſure they could have]</hi> neither is there a better ſigne of a true profiting by the Ordinances of God, and the Worſhip of Him tendred with others, then the riveting the ſtrength of them into the heart by <hi>ſolitary prayers</hi> and <hi>meditations,</hi> without delay.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is alſo no <hi>ſoule,</hi> but if it be obſervant of it ſelfe, will find it ſelfe to have need of more <hi>knowledge,</hi> then the Publike Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, or any Family Devotions beſides doe expreſly offer to it; and need to be remembred of more things, then are in thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances dilated upon; and ſo hath need of as much <hi>Time</hi> as may be, (and as its naturall ſpirits are able to hold out unto) to <hi>read the Scriptures,</hi> and other godly bookes; and to conſider its own <hi>conſcience,</hi> even in matters perhaps not named (or but named) in all the Ordinances that <hi>Day</hi> wherein they have joyned with others; and ſo to <hi>meditate,</hi> and read, and pray, and give thanks, concerning thoſe things, for its neceſſary edification and comfort. In all which reſpects, when ſpecially it can have but very little on the Working Dayes, it hath need of the more on the <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time,</hi> the <hi>ordinary Day for Gods worſhip,</hi> even the moſt <hi>large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> that Nature can afford to give.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Adde hereunto, That the <hi>Solitary Worſhip</hi> a man or woman tenders to God, is, in the nature of it, the moſt conſcientious, and the moſt undoubtedly <hi>godly</hi> of all other; as having leaſt of <hi>man,</hi> (if any thing at all, when it is inwardly performed, without uſing the voice) to recommend, encourage, or help it. It comes ſpecially from the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and is carried on by the Spirit of God; and in it, if ever, is the ſoule in <hi>Heaven,</hi> while it is upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Inſomuch as a man may truly ſay, that it, of all the reſt, is the <hi>beſt character</hi> of a Chriſtian, or faithfull ſervant of God; A man may, for want of opportunity, be deprived of the <hi>ſociety</hi> of others to joyn with him in <hi>publike</hi> or <hi>domeſtique</hi> devotions; and he may by ſickneſſe, or by lameneſſe, or the like accidents, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from going to the <hi>publike worſhip,</hi> and yet be never the leſſe <hi>godly,</hi> if he ſupply thoſe wants in perſonall and <hi>ſolitary devotions</hi> conſtantly: But without the practice of this, (as he hath Time and ſpirits) he cannot be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> whether he frequent and uſe conjoyned ſervices, or no.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally, becauſe thoſe <hi>conjoyned devotions</hi> are not certainly poſſible to all men, a great part of their lives; and may many
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:112963:109"/>
wayes be <hi>hindred</hi> from time to time; Therefore the <hi>ſufficient chiefe Time</hi> doth firſt and originally reſpect the <hi>ſolitary worſhip,</hi> from which no man can be at any time <hi>hindred,</hi> being awake, and not in extremity of <hi>ſickneſſe</hi> or paine, which almoſt takes away all ſpirits and ſenſes, unleſſe by particular preſſing neceſſities (which are the reſervations often mentioned before) and which are many times ſhort; and divers of them admit a great deale of <hi>freedome</hi> to renew ſuch <hi>ſolitary worſhip,</hi> as tending a ſick body, or a child, at home: And but ſecondarily takes in <hi>family-worſhip,</hi> as far as it is poſſible, (and it is poſſible to many, to whom <hi>publike conjoyned worſhip</hi> is not poſſible) and then in the third place, <hi>publike worſhip</hi> alſo, as far as it is likewiſe poſſible. And ſo all the three together are included (and to be included) within the extent of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> of this <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time</hi> neceſſarily and ordinarily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all men. And ſo we hope we have ſufficiently and fully aſſerted the firſt <hi>Qualification</hi> and Condition formerly laid down concerning the Determination of this <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time</hi> we have in hand.</p>
               <p>From which, before we paſſe to the next, let us but in a word remember the Reader to be thinke himſelfe, whether the <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> that muſt be extended to all theſe various kinds of Worſhip, <hi>Solitary, Domeſtick,</hi> and <hi>Publike,</hi> for all the purpoſes mentioned in the grounds laid down about them; can be leſſe then a <hi>whole Day,</hi> how ſeldome, or how often ſoever the <hi>Revolution</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be. And if ſo, then we beleeve we ſhall find an eaſier work then hath been imagined, to prove the <hi>perpetuall ſanctity of one whole Day in ſeven,</hi> according to what we ſay is the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the fourth Commandement. But of that more hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XLVIII. The ſecond Qualification</note>We proceed now to the ſecond Condition or <hi>Qualification,</hi> that we have delivered about this <hi>neceſſary ſufficient chiefe Time to be determined for all men:</hi> and that is, <hi>[That the proportion in the whole, of Continuance and Frequencie joyned, is to be no longer, then is certainly neceſſary for Gods honour, and the good of ſoules, and compatible with the neceſſary worldly callings of every one of mankinde:]</hi> that ſo it may be undoubtedly called, the <hi>Neceſſary Time for all men:</hi> (admitting ſtill, even within it, <hi>Reſervations</hi> for preſent Neceſsities interrupting) and that no <hi>ſober Conſcience,</hi> (however unwilling otherwiſe to ſpend ſuch a <hi>proportion of Time</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:112963:109"/>
conſtantly in Religion, or to allow it to others) can reaſonably deny it to be <hi>neceſſary for Religion,</hi> or challenge it as injurious to <hi>neceſſary</hi> worldly affaires.</p>
               <p>In this Point we ſhall not have our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> gainſaying us earneſtly, though ſome of them have ſpoken ſometimes,<note place="margin">1. Confeſſed.</note> as though the <hi>greater part</hi> of all our Times were to be given to God in duties of Solemn and Religious worſhip. Witneſſe one, whole words our margent refers to. VVhat he meant by it, we cannot,<note place="margin">Primt. part. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> S. <hi>4.</hi> There ſhould be more juſtice to beſtow more daies upon God, yea all, &amp;c. N. B.</note> for our parts, tell. But we mean to aſſert no ſuch thing <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as the ſtate of man is in this world; but the contrary, by reaſon of <hi>Gods indulgence of ſixe Dayes,</hi> that is, the greateſt part of them ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, with <hi>reſervations</hi> for ſome Solitary and Family-Worſhip, at leaſt twice a Day, as we argued before, (and reaſon good, if God allow <hi>reſervation</hi> for ſome worldly matters, conſtantly, out of His <hi>one Day,</hi> as for meat, and ſleep, and for extraordinary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo; that there ſhould be <hi>reſervations</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> and His <hi>Honour,</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> of Souls, in the ſix working Dayes, both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, and extraordinarily.) But now we are but in the way to prove that <hi>Indulgence of ſix Dayes</hi> for worldly matters, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of one in ſeven for Religion:</hi> we ſay then, that the <hi>whole proportion</hi> (within the <hi>revolution</hi> of a VVeek of ſeven Dayes, or any other number of Dayes) is not to be ſo large, but by <hi>juſt proofe</hi> it may be demonſtrated, that ſo <hi>large a proportion</hi> (and no leſſe) is certainly <hi>neceſſary for all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the proofe of this, in a word, is this,<note place="margin">2. Proved.</note> that hereby mens conſciences will be awed with the <hi>Determination,</hi> as altogether uncontrolable, and their <hi>mouths</hi> will be ſtopped, that for ſhame, (if they have any ſhame in them) they will not dare to ſay, that the commandement is a heavy <hi>yoke,</hi> or a burden really grievous, who ever be the <hi>Determiner</hi> immediately, <hi>God</hi> or <hi>men,</hi> ſuperiours, or ones own vow; And this, if any thing, will <hi>help</hi> mainly to ſecure the <hi>obſervation</hi> of it, by all, and among all; who elſe would be perpetually quarrelling and grumbling againſt it. And ſo what ever became of the <hi>Publique Worſhip,</hi> to which they might perhaps be ordinarily awed by the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and the <hi>Family-Worſhip</hi> alſo, where the Governour were ſtrict: Yet to be ſure they would never be tyed to the performance of <hi>Solitary Worſhip;</hi> but reject it, as an <hi>unreaſonable and intolerable impoſition,</hi> and ſo much too of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:112963:110"/>
either or both the other, as they durſt for <hi>feare</hi> of men, Superiours and Neighbours. We know, that how little ſo ever be required, by the moſt undeniable <hi>Authority</hi> of God Himſelf, yet every one of mankind will not regard it: but this is yet greatly different, to <hi>reject</hi> a commandement out of meere <hi>prophaneſſe</hi> (as they do, any of the reſt, and for which their conſciences give them many <hi>nip</hi> now, and will gnaw upon them eternally, if they repent not,) and to reject it, as an <hi>unſufferable burden,</hi> which the Commandments of God now under the New Teſtament cannot juſtly be ſaid to be. And ſo, what ever <hi>Time</hi> is pleaded for, as <hi>Gods Commandement</hi> now, we grant and aſſert, that the <hi>proportion</hi> of it, as we ſaid, muſt appeare to be <hi>undeniable neceſſary.</hi> And accordingly, though in another place we ſhall more fully argue it, yet here we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound again to the <hi>Readers</hi> Conſcience, this Queſtion, <hi>[VVhether out of the proportion of ſeven dayes, which containe</hi> 168. <hi>Houres, the waking Time of one day, which is ordinarily with moſt men, but fourteen or ſixteen houres, (or ſuppoſe it eighten or twenty, or even the whole twenty four) is too large a proportion for the chiefe ſolemne Time for all men, to attend the worſhip of God, and the good eternall of their own ſoules and others? And whether ſuch a proportion, at leaſt, is not neceſſary for all men, to imploy, and alſo compatible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly with any worldly buſineſſes?]</hi> We do not now argue, how it ſhould be diſtributed between the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequency,</hi> (whether all the <hi>Continuance</hi> to be in <hi>one day,</hi> or two, or more; or every day to ſhare alike) that we have already done Chap. 8. and ſhewed the whole proportion to be beſt all on <hi>one day;</hi> But we ſay, <hi>[Whether leſſe then ſuch a proportion in the whole, can be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Gods Honour and the ſoules ſalvation, or this can be juſtly excepted againſt as unneceſſary and injurious?]</hi> If ſober <hi>Conſciences</hi> put but this queſtion home to their own ſoules; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they will yeeld us the whole cauſe, and diſpute no further, though they have heretofore. But we go on to a third <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or condition of our <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> to be determined for all men; that is:</p>

                  <note place="margin">XLIX. The third qualification proved.</note>3.

                  <hi>for the chiefe Time.</hi> And of its ſufficiency, it is to be noted further. 1. That hereby there is <hi>no need of the Continuance to be determined to all men, for their daily Frequencies morning and evening alone, or in Families:</hi> But God is content to leave that to their ſeverall <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> (according to more generall Rules) and to their <hi>occaſions</hi> alſo: Becauſe there is ſo ſolemne a <hi>Continuance</hi> determined for them upon the <hi>chiefe Dayes.</hi> 2.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:112963:113"/>
for the ſolemne ſervice of <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Humiliation,</hi> there is both ſpeciall examples ſeeming at leaſt to determine the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> for them, as at the ordination of Miniſters, and in inſtant dangers, as alſo for the <hi>Continuance,</hi> not to be leſſe then a whole Day. But for other extraordinary occaſions, there is leſſe direction, and more left, as before, to mens particular affections, and conveniencies, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough; becauſe of the <hi>ſtrict determination</hi> of the <hi>Continuance,</hi> and <hi>Frequency</hi> of the <hi>ordinary chiefe ſolemne Time;</hi> which keepes all right and ſtraight in a ſpeciall manner, (and directs to right af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections for particular occaſions,) if carefully and conſcionably obſerved. 3. To which we may in the laſt place adde (in a word now, for haply we may be neceſſitated to ſay a little more of it hereafter:) The ſufficiency of the Continuance of the ordinary chiefe Time, being rightly and wiſely determined and ſetled; there is <hi>no need of an univerſall, or peremptory determination of this Continuance diſtributively, betweene the Solitary Worſhip, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Worſhip, and the Publike Worſhip:</hi> that is, there is no need, <hi>[That all men ſhould be bound, to ſuch an exact or ſtrict Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in each of theſe ſingle.]</hi> But ſo the <hi>whole Continuance</hi> be ſhared betweene all three, and the <hi>Publike</hi> be not <hi>ſo ſhort,</hi> as to afford no remarkable ſpace for an affecting, prayer, and preaching, and the like, and ſo no remarkable benefit to be gotten by it; nor <hi>ſo long</hi> as to tyre out the ſpirits, and diſappoint thoſe that dwell farre off, of conveniency of returne to their family, and ſolitary, devotions, (beſides the regard of bodily neceſſities) It can hardly be blamed, though ſome be longer, and ſome ſhorter in publike, and ſo in the reſt. For as much as God ſtill hath (and ſo alſo every ones ſoule hath) the <hi>full Continuance</hi> determined, and allotted; which conſcionably obſerved in the varieties of thoſe Duties, may be, and will be <hi>ordinarily ſufficient</hi> for their conſciences, and ſoules good, and ſo acceptable to God; though ſometimes more of the Time be ſpent in publike, and ſometimes more in private.</p>
               <p>And ſo at laſt we have done with the proofe of the <hi>neceſſity of ſuch a chiefe ſolemne Time</hi> to be determined, for the neceſſary and ordinarily ſufficient Time for all men. It remaines that now in the laſt place we come to argue, <hi>[By whom this determination muſt be, or may be made?]</hi> But for that, the next Chapter is purpoſely reſerved; this having been already drawne out to a more then

               <p>And yet there is one thing behind for the cloſe of this Chapter.<note place="margin">LII. How farre the Law of Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands about the <hi>Quando,</hi> or ſeaſon.</note> And that is, a briefe diſcourſe <hi>about the</hi> Quando, <hi>ſeaſon, or order of beginning,</hi> when once the former <hi>determination</hi> is <hi>Concluſively</hi> ſetled for the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequency</hi> of the <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time.</hi> How farre the Law, or light of Nature will guide or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand about this, or any generall Rules of Scripture. Leaving the queſtion, <hi>by whom</hi> it alſo is to be determined, unto the following Chapter, and here only, touching in a few words, (for many will not need about it; It having no ſuch <hi>ſubſtantiall profit,</hi> as the Continuance and Frequency, toward Religion, but only <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall,</hi> as is needfull to be againe and againe inculcated to our adverſaries, who would caſt off all that was heretofore determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, becauſe this is taken away:) Touching we ſay, <hi>how farre it is neceſſary that there be any determination ſtrictly and concluſively, of the</hi> Quando, <hi>ſeaſon, or order of beginning:</hi> that is, <hi>for the particular Day,</hi> of that number that is determined, for the chiefe Time of Worſhip; and even of the <hi>beginning</hi> of that Day, ſooner or later, at evening, or morning, this, or that houre. Now this I ſhall diſpatch in foure Propoſitions. 1. <hi>There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that ſome particular Day (of ſuch a number determined) be determined before that number can be conſtantly obſerved.</hi> 2. <hi>There is a neceſſity, that to all that live within the reach one of another, and ſo may poſſibly be helpes one to another, or hindrances one to another, the ſame particular Day, of ſuch a number be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; and ſo farre at leaſt the ſame ſeaſon of beginning the Day, that all may afford convenient helpe to each other, and none prove hindrances one to the other.</hi> 3. <hi>It ſeemes moſt conſonant to the Law and light of Nature, and Scripture-reaſon, that (unleſſe God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it otherwiſe Himſelfe) the beginning of the Day ſhould be in the morning, that is after midnight, rather then in the evening before.</hi> 4. <hi>It ſeemes greatly conducible to the honour of God from all mankind, and to the generall Communion of Saints all the world over, that the ſame particular Day (of ſuch a number) ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to all men of the ſame age,</hi> (that is, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the ſame from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Worlds end) <hi>all the World over; to obſerve it, according as that Day begins with them in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they live and are.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">LIII. 1. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that ſome Day be determined.</note>For the firſt of theſe, It may eaſily be made good, even by this one Conſideration; That making the inſtance in any one number, as ſuppoſe one Day in ten be determined; it thence inevitably followes, that the very <hi>neglect of determining another particular Day,</hi> makes the Determination fall <hi>upon the laſt</hi> of the ten: For when all the other nine are ſlipped over, and none of them deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, the laſt of the ten unavoidably muſt be obſerved, the <hi>firſt revolution;</hi> and withall remaines <hi>for ever after determined;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a new Day be afterward determined by as ſufficient authority, as was in the determiner of the number; and then alſo, without an alteration of the determination of the number, <hi>the new deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination can only be placed upon one particular Day,</hi> namely the <hi>firſt of the ten.</hi> And ſo if it be done by ſufficient authority, it may be done without any violation or alteration of the <hi>determination of the number</hi> at all; For the ſtrength of the determination of the number lies in theſe things. 1. That there ſhould be but one Day for Religion, to nine for worldly buſineſſe: and againe, but nine for worldly buſineſſe, to one for Religion, (and neither more nor leſſe either way, ordinarily.) 2. That thoſe nine Dayes, being the number of working Dayes, ſhould come all together; and the Day for Religion not come between them; for then ſometimes there would be leſſe then nine together, and ſometimes more. Now this is obſerved plainly and undeniably in both reſpects, in the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced change from the tenth Day, to the firſt Day. For in thoſe two Revolutions of twice ten Dayes, there are but two Dayes for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the laſt of the firſt ten, and the firſt of the latter ten: and there is twice nine Dayes for worldly buſineſſe; and in each Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, either number of nine worldly Dayes are entirely all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Dayes for Religion come not in to break the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as they would doe, if the ſecond Day were determined; for then there would be one Day for work only, and the next for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſo not nine work-dayes together: and again, if the ninth Day were determined, then there would have been in that Revolution but eight Dayes together for work, and a ninth (not a tenth,<note place="margin">Objection.</note> according to the determination formerly ſetled for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) obſerved for Religion. If any ſay, that this would be how ever but for <hi>once,</hi> and that were no great matter, ſpecially if <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion loſe nothing</hi> by it, as by bringing the Day ſooner, it would
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:112963:114"/>
not: We anſwer, It is true, if the authority be ſufficient,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> to change the number, the matter is not of importance: But if the authority, that would change the order of the particular Day from the tenth to the ninth, or ſo, (and ever after keep a tenth from that) yet hath not alſo an authority ſufficient to change the number; that one <hi>alteration</hi> would make them guilty of tranſgreſſion of a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> Commandement of God, namely in the point of the number, which even <hi>once</hi> muſt not be done by men, under any pretence whatſoever. To apply this now in a word to our buſineſſe in hand, as God unqueſtionably determined for the Jewes, (and we ſay, for the old world) the laſt of the ſeven; ſo upon the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of one Day in ſeven, perpetually determined, as we ſay, in the fourth Commandement: And ſuppoſing alſo that the Church had power, after Chriſts <hi>reſurrection and aſcention,</hi> to change that Day to another Day of the ſeven; Yet by this argumentation, they will be found to be determined to the <hi>firſt</hi> Day of the Week, and to no other, (whenſoever they ſhould make the change) for elſe, doe what they can, they would the firſt time break the number, which <hi>without ſpeciall allowance</hi> they might not doe without ſinne. And ſo in concluſion it will come to this paſſe, that it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be Gods own determination, even by vertue of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber remaining perpetually determined in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And ſo in that ſenſe <hi>(ſuppoſing the old ſeventh Day abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated)</hi> we may both <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> ſay, <hi>The firſt Day of the Week</hi> (the Lords day) <hi>is determined to us,</hi> and muſt be obſerved by us, even by vertue of the <hi>fourth Commandement:</hi>

For though God, we doubt not, might have altered it to any other Day, and even have wholly altered the number, and taken one of ſix, or five, or one only of eight, or ten, at His pleaſure, whoſe all Times are, (as we have often ſaid, and deſire often to remember:) yet He perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating

the <hi>number,</hi> no man, or number of men in the Church could by humane authority determine any other Day for <hi>order;</hi> but the firſt, in ſtead of the laſt, muſt ſucceed; beſides the high reaſon for that Day, from Chriſts reſurrection, and reſting from the work of our <hi>Redemption:</hi> of which hereafter in due place.

And this may ſerve rationally to anſwer a difficulty,<note place="margin">A difficulty diſſolved.</note> ſuppoſed to be inſuperable, and oppoſed by the Hiſtorian, expreſly to overthrow the <hi>Lords day;</hi> namely, <hi>What is to be done by ſuch, who travelling Eaſt or Weſt to ſuch Degrees, come to find, that they have loſt, or gained a Day in their computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſo to queſtion <hi>what Day</hi> they ſhould obſerve; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>what beginning</hi> of the Day, becauſe the Climates vary ſo much, that when it is morning in one, it is noon in another, and night in another, and ſo proportionably, as they travell.

And here is indeed <hi>no inconvenience,</hi> nor any thing to bogle at, by ſuch as count <hi>Gods ſervice,</hi> and the good of their <hi>ſoules,</hi> and participation of His Ordinances orderly with others, matters of more conſequence then the <hi>nicety</hi> of <hi>Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall obſervations</hi> of minutes, and houres, and Climates, and the like. God certainly is not the <hi>author of confuſion,</hi> neither would have his ſervants in the ſame Country be divided in their <hi>Solemne Times,</hi> by the occaſion of a long journey that ſome of them have taken, (though for once it may be with ſome, as thoſe in a journey at the ſeaſon of the Paſſeover, were to keep it that yeere, the moneth after; but not ſo the next yeere, but with their brethren) And much leſſe may it be imagined, that God ſets ſo light by His <hi>Solemne Times,</hi> as that ſuch a <hi>nicety</hi> as this <hi>occaſionall accident</hi> (or any other variation of Climates, and long time of Light or the like) ſhould diſanull His Commandement about it.

               </p>
               <p>We proceed to the third Propoſition about the beginning of the particular Day; and that is, <hi>[It ſeemes moſt conſonant to the Law and Light of Nature, and Scripture reaſon, that (unleſſe God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe

determine it himſelfe) the beginning of the Day ſhould be in the morning, that is, after midnight, rather then the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.]</hi> We put in that <hi>Parentheſis, (unleſſe God otherwiſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it himſelfe)</hi> As well that we may never, neither by way of <hi>conſequence,</hi> nor ſo much as in <hi>appearance,</hi> diſpute againſt any <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God:</hi> acknowledging everlaſtingly, that <hi>all His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,</hi> (what ever we may ſurmiſe or argue) are <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt,</hi> ſo long, and ſo much, as He will have them ſtand: As alſo for that it is commonly taken for an undoubted and undeniable truth, <hi>[That the old Jewiſh Sabbath did begin (and ſo end) at Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.]</hi> Whether it did ſo certainly, or no, perhaps we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider more particularly hereafter. But for the preſent, we cannot forbeare to ſay, that we are <hi>no way convinced that it ended in the Evening,</hi> (though we will not now neither diſpute that in point of fact.) But all we will doe for the preſent about it, is to ſhew our grounds, why (under favour of Gods not determining other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as we ſaid) we conceive it moſt ſutable to Religious reaſon, that the <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time ſhould not end, till our waking Time ends,</hi> or till Midnight: and ſo conſequently, if it muſt be a whole Dayes continuance, (as we ſuppoſe it muſt) the beginning muſt be at Midnight,<note place="margin">The reaſon of that aſſertion.</note> and not the Evening before. Our reaſon is, That if we conſider the <hi>Evening</hi> before, or the <hi>Evening</hi> after, there will be perpetuall danger of <hi>incroachment</hi> either upon the <hi>Religious Time,</hi> or the <hi>Worldly Time,</hi> to the prejudice of one of them; but ſpecially of Religion in moſt men. 1. Conſider the <hi>Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> In winter time, it is Evening with us at five a clock, a good part of the Time, and at foure, for a week or two, or more. If now as ſoon as it growes dark, the Time for Religion begins; They muſt, to obſerve it aright, and have their minds in frame, lay aſide their worldly buſineſſes a while at leaſt before; and this will at leaſt ſeem to <hi>incroach too much upon their buſineſſes,</hi> and diſappoint <hi>Markets</hi> on the Day before, and <hi>Journies</hi> very much ſometimes: Or rather the hazard will be, that <hi>worldly things will ſtick to mens fingers, and buſineſſes in their minds,</hi> ſo long, that what with Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, and other Night-buſineſſes before they goe to bed, and many haſting to bed, under pretence perhaps of earlier riſing in the Morning, (though likely enough they mean nothing leſſe, nor do they riſe the earlier for it:) God and the ſoule would have very
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:112963:116"/>
little, even of thoſe houres, after four or five a clock, (beſides what conſcientious men uſe to give Him every night) and ſo ſcarce worth the while of reckoning the <hi>Religious</hi> Time (or Day for it) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at Evening, ſpecially conſidering the <hi>great loſſe</hi> that would in all likelihood be by the <hi>ending of it at Even;</hi> which is the ſecond Conſideration. For ſuppoſing the Day ended at foure, or five, or ſixe a clock: either men would ſtill <hi>continue their Religious thoughts,</hi> as to cloſe fairly their waking Time with them; and this would be againe thought too much, becauſe the former Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was challenged as Gods due, (whether He had it or not,) Or elſe, which would be infallibly with the moſt of men, they would inſtantly, when it grew darke, or at Sun-ſet, (which I take it was the Jewes Evening, ending thoſe Dayes that did end at Even, as the Day of Expiation, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.23.) <hi>throw away all thoughts of Religion,</hi> and fall to worke, or buying and ſelling in ſhops, or to ſports and play: which cannot poſſibly but be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to Religion, by <hi>weakning the good they had received before in the Day:</hi> and even making them loſe any godly affections they had gotten, by a cold dampe, deading any ſpirituall heat that might be put into them by the ordinances and ſervices of God, publike, or domeſtick, or ſolitary, by one, or all. Hereunto we may adde, that upon the knowledge of this ending at that houre, there would be before-hand matches made of meeting to make bargaines, to game and play, and perhaps to drink and carowſe, (the Day being now over) and then even <hi>before it were over,</hi> the minds of moſt world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people would ſo run upon thoſe things, even while they were in the exerciſes of devotion, that they will make very little benefit by them; but they will, as it were, ſit upon thornes, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ordinances, and rather then faile, goe out in the midſt of them, if they miſdoubt or diſcerne that they are like to trench upon their worldly times. And for this we would but appeale even to ſober conſciences, when they ſometimes heare a <hi>Sermon on the Week-dayes,</hi> after which <hi>immediately they have worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> (or even but a meeting of pleaſure) to attend upon; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe things doe not <hi>much run in their heads,</hi> and make them ſit in paine and feare, and long that it were done; and even tempt them to goe out (unleſſe ſhame hold them) and <hi>leave it before the end,</hi> or ſpecially before the end of Prayer, Pſalme, and Bleſſing.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:112963:117"/>
And then it would be undoubtedly much worſe with ordinary people, as appeares but too manifeſtly by their goings out both morning and afternoon, as ſoon as they think the Sermon ſhould end, (the glaſſe being run) or that it is ended, and they haſten to their dinner, or to ſerve their cattell, or the like.</p>
               <p>But now by the <hi>beginning and ending at Midnight,</hi> (or the Morning, which is ordinarily all one) ſo as one <hi>wakes in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Day, and lies down to ſleep in it;</hi> All the <hi>inconvenience</hi> on both ſides is prevented. Men may follow their buſineſſes the Night before, that they may the leſſe diſturbe them on the Day for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and their <hi>Night-devotions</hi> may ſettle their minds againſt the next Day: and then on that Day, <hi>all the waking Time</hi> being determined for Religion, it will plainly <hi>ſecure</hi> very much all the <hi>good gotten,</hi> and <hi>keepe out</hi> all miſchievous diſappointments by <hi>worldly thoughts and diſcourſes;</hi> and to ſettle a mans ſpirit excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, by <hi>lying down with thoſe thoughts</hi> of God and Religion; and ſo ſleeping as in Gods armes, may make all ſingularly happy to him. And if this be ſo, they are ſurely not ſo well adviſed, that have ſo ridgedly urged the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Lords day to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily at <hi>Evening,</hi> (as they ſuppoſe it was with the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.) But we have ſomewhat further to ſay to them about that, from our Saviours <hi>Reſurrection</hi> in the <hi>Morning.</hi> Of which we ſhall diſcourſe hereafter.</p>

For they in <hi>Heaven,</hi> doe keepe a <hi>conſtant and everlaſting ſolemne Sabbatiſme</hi> (as it is

The reaſon is, <hi>they above have no other worke to doe;</hi> but to ſerve and Worſhip God, they are ſpirits without bodies: we on earth have bodies to care for as well as ſoules; we have other callings commanded us, to attend on, as well as on Gods ſolemne Worſhip.

All which is prevented, (and only ſo) by having all, in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, of the World, the ſame particular Day, and beginning of it, as we have ſaid. And ſo we have, at length, diſpatched the whole of what we judge conſiderable about the <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>ſolemne Time generally,</hi> and of the <hi>chiefe Time for Religion in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> Except <hi>by whom</hi> the determination of this chiefe Time is to be made, which now followes in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>The matter we propound to be ſtrengthned, is the poſition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the title of the Chapter <hi>[That the Determination of the chiefe Solemne Time for all men, neceſſary and ordinarily ſufficient for the chiefe Time; as alſo the particular day for it, belongs not to men but to God.]</hi> To ſtate this clearely, we muſt needs repeate a little of our foregoing diſcourſes, and adde a few words more for full underſtanding of it.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By the <hi>Determination not belonging to men, but to God,</hi> for this <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> (as alſo for the <hi>particular day</hi> of it,) we meane that <hi>all the authority that men have about it, is but declarative and obedientiall, not legiſlative or deciſive.</hi> Men have onely to exerciſe their <hi>Wiſdomes</hi> to <hi>find out what Determination God hath made of it in his written word,</hi> and how much reaſon there is to <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the wiſdome and graciouſneſſe of Gods Determinations</hi> in all the reſpects: And not to ſet their wits a work to <hi>find out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> or from any generall grounds of nature or Scripture, <hi>other Times,</hi> as <hi>neceſſary and ſufficient for this chiefe Time for all men,</hi> (or any <hi>other particular</hi> day,) which God hath not appointed.

of all men and times</hi> (of the times of all men) <hi>hath reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> as a parcell of his prerogative royal, from the worlds beginning to the worlds end, the <hi>Determination of the chiefe ſolemne Time for all men,</hi> neceſſary and ordinarily ſufficient for the chiefe Time; and of <hi>the particular dayes</hi> for it. And accordingly, theſe are to be found in His <hi>writter word,</hi> namely an <hi>expreſſe Determination of the chiefe ſolemne Time for Contiunance and Frequency,</hi> and a <hi>ſufficient deſignation, of the particular dayes</hi> for it, in both ages of the Church.<note place="margin">II. The queſtion confirmed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The queſtion thus ſtated, we ſhall propound ſundry ſort of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to confirme our poſition, ſome <hi>againſt mens authority,</hi> whether taken ſeverally, or any number of men together; and ſome expreſly <hi>for Gods authority.</hi> Again, ſome concerning <hi>all the reſpects of Time together;</hi> others concerning the <hi>Continuance and Frequency joyntly,</hi> which make up the <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> and that both in reference to the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>ſo much,</hi> and <hi>ſo often,</hi> and to the <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of it, for the <hi>chiefe</hi> Time: others concerning <hi>either of thoſe reſpects in ſpeciall,</hi> the <hi>Continuance</hi> and the <hi>Frequency,</hi> and finally, ſome which refer ſpecially to the <hi>particular dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt we begin to oppugne <hi>Mens authority</hi> generally,<note place="margin">III.

               <p>The Major we may eaſily confirme; 1.<note place="margin">Hiſt. Sab. part <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> From the <hi>words of one of themſelves</hi> in another caſe <hi>[Non credimus, quia non legimus.]</hi> But more from the <hi>nature of conſcience,</hi> which can have no other <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>ground</hi> in matters of importance, but either the <hi>law of nature,</hi> or the <hi>Scipture,</hi> which latter indeed alone is ſo complete a <hi>treaſury of all the will of God towards us,</hi> as what is not <hi>at leaſt inſinuated</hi> there, is in no wiſe to be admitted in any <hi>matter of importance</hi> in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>

whether of <hi>beleefe</hi> or <hi>practiſe:</hi> For as much as <hi>it containes</hi> (at leaſt, we ſay, by way of <hi>inſinuation) all that the law or light of nature doth or can ſay toward Religion;</hi> and having expreſt many things more, which the light or law of nature is not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or ſpeake to. And therefore a <hi>Conſcience</hi> dares lay no waight upon what the <hi>Scripture</hi> is wholly ſilent in, and much leſſe when the <hi>law of nature</hi> doth not pretend to ſpeake for it neither. Now that this <hi>Determination of the chiefe ſolemne Time of Worſhip for all men,</hi> is a matter of <hi>maineſt importance in Religion,</hi> we ſuppoſe we have abundantly ſhewed in the two former Chapters, beyond the deniall of any Conſcience; unto which we may breefly adde, that it is a thing of ſingular waight in reference both to <hi>ſuperiours,</hi> and <hi>inferiours;</hi> thoſe that may pretend, or <hi>offer to make</hi> this Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, or <hi>neglect to make</hi> it: and thoſe again that <hi>obey, it being made</hi> by others, or <hi>obey it not.</hi> For on every hand there is ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable, if we follow not the will of God revealed in <hi>nature,</hi> or in His <hi>Word.</hi> 1. If they <hi>take upon them to make</hi> this Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>to whom God hath given no ſuch authority,</hi> they grievouſly ſin to uſurpe upon his <hi>Prerogative Royall,</hi> or to uſurpe authority not granted them. 2. If they <hi>neglect to make it, to whom God hath granted the Authority,</hi> they ſin alſo, in being <hi>wanting to ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a duty,</hi> and buſineſſe of Religion; or perhaps alſo to the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſuperſtitious conceit of thoſe that think it determined by God, when it is not. 3. If thoſe that have Authority, make it <hi>too large in the whole proportion,</hi> in that they ſin, in being <hi>over burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi> to men, and rendring the ſervice of God tedious and irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and making men to throw it off for the burdenſomneſſe of it, even beyond that proportion, which perhaps they would have been contented to have obſerved, if it had been more moderately appointed. 4. If they <hi>diſtribute the proportion too unequally,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequency,</hi> here again they ſin, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing either <hi>Religion,</hi> by <hi>too ſhort</hi> continuances, or <hi>too ſeldome</hi> revolution; or <hi>worldly buſineſſes</hi> over much, by <hi>too frequent</hi> revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions ſpecially: which again will redound to the prejudice of Religion, as before. 5. If they make the <hi>proportion, too ſcanty in the whole,</hi> they ſin unqueſtionably, againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> Gods <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and the <hi>ſoules good.</hi> 6. If they find a <hi>Determination made by others, wiſely,</hi> they ſin if they offer to alter it any way, that is,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:112963:121"/>
to the worſe. 7. If they find it <hi>unfitly made</hi> in any reſpect, they ſinne if they alter it not, for the better. And the reaſon is the like for thoſe that are to <hi>obey the Determination,</hi> they ſinne if they <hi>aſcribe Authority,</hi> and <hi>yeeld obedience to thoſe to whom God hath given none;</hi> and they ſinne on the other hand, if they <hi>deny Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unto thoſe to whom God hath given it,</hi> or if they <hi>deny their obedience,</hi> ſpecially in a <hi>matter ſo neerely concerning Gods honour,</hi> and the <hi>good of their ſoules.</hi> (Beſides what is to be ſaid of the <hi>proportion,</hi> or <hi>diſtribution</hi> appearing <hi>equall,</hi> or <hi>notoriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall,</hi> of which anon.) So that in all this, there is nothing for the conſciences of all ſorts of men, that meddle, or meddle not with this Determination, obey it, or obey it not, to reſt upon: but a <hi>certaine Authority</hi> to be pleaded from the <hi>law of nature</hi> or <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> for thoſe that offer to make it, or obey it. Or a <hi>certainty, that men have no ſuch Authority left them by God.</hi> And that our minor expreſſes, which we beleeve we ſhall ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> we have already noted. 1.<note place="margin">IV. Neither by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> That <hi>originally God is unqueſtionably the Soveraigne and abſolute Lord of all Time,</hi> and ſo that it primarily belongs to Him to determine the <hi>chiefe and neceſſary Times</hi> of His owne Worſhip. 2. That the <hi>Law and light of Nature doth not determine, nor cannot helpe men to determine Concluſively the Continuance and Frequency joyntly,</hi> and ſo not the <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time of Worſhip for all men.</hi> 3. And this is both confeſſed (and urged againſt the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being <hi>Morall-Naturall</hi> for a <hi>Seventh Day Sabbath</hi>) by all our adverſaries that diſpute about theſe things. From all which it plainly followes, that <hi>the Law of Nature doth not, nor cannot grant unto men the authority of determining this chiefe Time of Worſhip neceſſary for all men:</hi> But rather denies it them: As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing againſt the light of Nature, that they ſhould have the authority of <hi>determining</hi> that which they have no light in Nature for the <hi>porportion</hi> of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Scripture,</hi> there is as little for this authority <hi>there,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. Nor by the Scripture.</note> as in <hi>Nature,</hi> for we challenge our adverſaries or any for them, to to produce the Booke, Chapter, or verſe, of the Bible, <hi>that gives any ſo much as an intimation,</hi> that God hath <hi>put off this authority to men,</hi> which was <hi>originally</hi> a part of His <hi>owne Prerogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi>

Is it any where ſaid, in expreſſe Words, or to any ſuch effect, <hi>[That God, though He determined the Times of His Worſhip to His Church of old, yet He will not doe ſo to His Church now, under the New Teſtament. Or that He will not have any one of His Antient determinations to ſtand in force in any reſpect, But, though it be ſtill as neceſſary as ever to have ſolemne Times determined for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion unto all men, ſpecially a chiefe Time, to be ordinarily ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet He utterly refuſes to meddle any more in determining, or diſtributing the proportions of it, but leaves it wholly to men, they may and ſhall, and muſt determine it.]</hi> Is there we ſay, any the leaſt <hi>intimation,</hi> of Gods <hi>putting this authority out of His owne hands into mens,</hi> in the New Teſtament? Or any thing like it, of His <hi>not meddling with determining any Times</hi> to mankind, till He had brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But that <hi>Adam,</hi> notwithſtanding the contrary <hi>intimation</hi> (to ſay the leaſt of it now, which we ſhall particularly diſcuſſe hereafter) <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. was wholly <hi>left without any determination from God, for any ſolemne Times;</hi> and ſo all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, <hi>Noah, and Abraham,</hi> and the reſt, <hi>till Moſes his Time,</hi> and till <hi>the fall of Manna.</hi> Is it any where ſaid, or any reaſon of it to be gathered from <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>theſe had the whole authority, of determining this neceſſary chiefe ſolemne Time for all men,</hi> or that <hi>any elſe</hi> had it of mankind. <hi>Some</hi> muſt have it, <hi>God</hi> ſtill, or <hi>men,</hi> We referre it then unto any conſcience to judge, whether it is fit to ſay or beleeve, without any Scripture, or Reaſon, that God, to whom it originally belonged, and whoſe Honour and Service it ſo mainly concerned, (beſides His care of mens ſoules) did put it over to men, we knew not to whom? nor why?</p>
               <p>All that can be pretended, is, that ſome of our adverſaries ſay, <hi>that there is no mention of</hi> Adam <hi>or the Patriarkes, keeping the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day Sabbath.</hi> No more ſay we, is there of <hi>their keeping any ſufficient Time,</hi> any ſuch, <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> as is proved and confeſſed, to be <hi>neceſſary to be determined, and obſerved for Religion.</hi> We now argue not of the <hi>proportion,</hi> but <hi>who determined</hi> it, <hi>determined</hi> it was, being ſo <hi>neceſſary to Religion</hi> for all men. And it <hi>originally</hi> belonged to God. Let them then that liſt or dare, beleeve, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scripture, and againſt the light of Nature, that <hi>He put it over to men:</hi> We dare not. And this may ſuffice for our firſt, and generall Argument. For as for that which is alledged for <hi>the

The <hi>Antecedent</hi> requires a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, as having two members: whereof the firſt is, <hi>[That it is neceſſary in reaſon, that the authority of determining the chiefe ſolemne Time being left to men, it ſhould be left to every one ſingle.]</hi> This may be cleared, by conſidering, that the obſervation of ſuch a Time being neceſſary to all men, at leaſt to be imployed in <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Worſhip,</hi> if they cannot have the opportunity of <hi>Domeſtick</hi> and <hi>Publike Worſhip</hi> alſo, as hath been proved before in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter: This cannot certainly be obſerved by all men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe every one have power and authority in himſelfe <hi>ſingle,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it for himſelfe, in caſe others will not, or doe not. And it is undeniably certaine, that in many places in the world there are none to determine to others a ſufficient ſolemne Time for the worſhip of God; as in all Pagan Countries: In thoſe <hi>places</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either men muſt have <hi>authority</hi> to determine for themſelves <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> ſingle, or they ſhall have none determined to them: and ſo it ſhall be left to the will of other men, whether they ſhall <hi>attend</hi> upon God, and the care of their own ſoules, ſufficiently. <hi>Ob.</hi> If any would ſay, that ſuch may <hi>attend</hi> upon God, and the care of their own ſoules ſufficiently, without any <hi>antecedent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of their own, or others. 1.

want of <hi>ſteady wiſedome</hi> to allot, without an <hi>antecedent determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſufficient <hi>Times</hi> for Religion. 2. Beſides, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the ſtate of the Queſtion; for we are now ſuppoſing, a <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> muſt be made, (the authority is left to ſome men, or elſe it is ſtill in <hi>Gods</hi> hands, and His <hi>determinations</hi> already made muſt ſtand, that is, ſome of them.) It muſt not then be anſwered, that any may ſufficiently obſerve <hi>Time</hi> for God, without a <hi>determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> It remaines therefore, that Time being to be obſerved, and determined that it may be obſerved, even a <hi>chief and ſufficient Time</hi> for <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequencie both jointly,</hi> and that for all men; It muſt be left to <hi>all men</hi> ſeverally, if to <hi>men</hi> at all, that ſo (at leaſt in the <hi>neglect</hi> of others) God nor their ſoules may not want their <hi>ſufficient Times</hi> determined.

By laying together, 1. the <hi>unwillingneſſe</hi> that is in the moſt to be bound to, or by any <hi>determination</hi> of ſuch <hi>neceſſary and ſufficient Time</hi> for Religion: unwillingnes to <hi>obſerve</hi> it, even though themſelves deny not Gods <hi>expreſſe determination.</hi> 2.

And theſe three would be ſure to be laid together in the minds of very many of mankind, as thus. 1. Their own <hi>unwillingneſſe</hi> would make them backward to <hi>determine</hi> any <hi>Times</hi> at all, ſpecially when no man could ſhew them out of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> had given them any ſuch <hi>expreſſe command</hi> to make ſuch <hi>determination</hi> to themſelves. 2.

of Time, nor ſcarce to obſerve any; as would be, and is the caſe of thouſands and thouſands. And if men now diſpute, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were bound to no <hi>Sabbath</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that the <hi>Commandement</hi> is not given to <hi>ſervants;</hi> becauſe of the <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience</hi> of ſufferings, and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of obeying maſters, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding work, (though we ſhall refute theſe ſufficiently in due time:) much more would <hi>ſervants,</hi> and ſuch perſons under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection think themſelves not tyed to obſerve any <hi>conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions</hi> of Times as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and much leſſe <hi>determine</hi> any to themſelves, which would bring ſuch <hi>hazards</hi> upon themſelves, and the Scripture being ſo ſilent in bidding them <hi>determine</hi> any ſuch <hi>Times,</hi> as it is plain it is; and having <hi>determined</hi> none to them, as is ſuppoſed and ſaid by our <hi>Diſputers.</hi> 3. All this would be much more ſtrong in their conceit, and hinder them for any ſuch <hi>ſufficient determination</hi> (or obſervation) by their want of <hi>wiſedome,</hi> and want of a <hi>rule,</hi> to determine the <hi>ſufficient</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Time</hi> by: They will thinke, that if it were the <hi>will</hi> of God to have us deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine for our ſelves any <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſufficient Times</hi> (the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of which will be ſo prejudiciall and hazardous to us) He would have given us a <hi>rule</hi> to goe by, and not put us to <hi>trouble,</hi> and <hi>danger of ſufferings,</hi> in a buſineſſe where we muſt grope in the darke, and know not whether we goe too faſt, or too ſlow, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine too much, or too little at once, too often, or too ſeldome. (And this want of <hi>wiſedome,</hi> and want of a <hi>rule,</hi> is a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing argument that <hi>God</hi> hath not <hi>left</hi> it at all to men, as we ſhall ſhew expreſly anon.) And what any of our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> or any other could plead againſt ſuch a mans <hi>allegations,</hi> that this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, for theſe reaſons, was not, nor is not <hi>left</hi> to him for himſelfe; but either there is to be none, or ſome other have the <hi>authority,</hi> (or rather God himſelfe ſtill:) We know not what to <hi>imagine,</hi> in ſuch ſilence of the Scripture in it; nor how they could <hi>urge</hi> his conſcience, and convince him of <hi>ſinne,</hi> upon their Tenets, for not <hi>determining,</hi> or even not <hi>obſerving</hi> ſuch <hi>ſufficient Times.</hi> Let them conſider it.

at all, or never <hi>ſufficient Times.</hi> It cannot then be imagined, that God ſhould, upon theſe <hi>termes,</hi> leave the <hi>authority to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the neceſſary and ſufficient Times for His Worſhip, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to every man ſingle.</hi> Let us ſumme up this proofe of our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent</hi> in this branch, in the enſuing <hi>Syllogiſme:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[That which ſuppoſes God to leave a thing of exceeding impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Religion, to the conſciences and judgements of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable man to determine, is not to be credited or admitted. But to ſay, that God hath given the authority to every man ſingle to determine for himſelfe the neceſſary and ſufficient Times of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is to leave a thing of exceeding importance in Religion, to the conſciences and judgements of every unconſcionable man to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Ergo, That He hath given them any ſuch authority, is not to be credited nor admitted.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is certaine, as well becauſe, 1. No <hi>Inſtance</hi> can be given of any other <hi>matter</hi> of like nature ſo left to <hi>every mans</hi> conſcience to <hi>determine.</hi> 2. As alſo becauſe it ſeemes a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall contradiction, [That any thing of exceeding importance in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſhould be left to the conſcience and judgement of any man to determine, much leſſe of every man for himſelfe, (ſpecially when it were ſo certaine, that nothing would be done by the moſt, or nothing to any purpoſe) It being the nature of Religion, to be a binder of mens conſciences.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be denied, by that which hath been often diſcourſed of the <hi>importance</hi> and neceſſity of ſuch <hi>determination</hi> for Religion: and by the undeniable <hi>unconſcionableneſſe</hi> of many, even of the moſt of men. The <hi>Concluſion</hi> then will follow, <hi>[That God hath not left it to every man ſingle.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We adde a ſecond <hi>proofe</hi> hereof,<note place="margin">IX. 2.

In that againe, for want of <hi>expreſſe proofe</hi> of the <hi>authority</hi> given him to <hi>determine</hi> his <hi>own Time,</hi> and for want of a <hi>cleare rule</hi> to meaſure his proportions of <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſufficient</hi> by; he would <hi>infallibly</hi> &amp; unavoidably be ſo <hi>interrupted</hi> &amp; checked in and for his <hi>obſervations,</hi> which he could not juſtifie by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>rationall plea,</hi> that he would often be even forced to intermit

and omit his <hi>determined Times;</hi> and even in thoſe that he did <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> be often <hi>unquiet</hi> in his mind and ſpirit: ſometimes <hi>doubting</hi> he obſerved not <hi>enough,</hi> and ſometimes perhaps <hi>too much,</hi> and ſo <hi>too ſeldome,</hi> or <hi>too often;</hi> and even on <hi>unſeaſonable Dayes,</hi> (as they would often prove by mens <hi>interruptions</hi> and buſineſſes) And by <hi>all,</hi> miſſe of much <hi>good,</hi> and of much comfort which he might have had, in deſpight of all men, if <hi>theſe Times</hi> had been unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably determined by God himſelfe to him. A <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> ſhall cloſe this: <q>[That which ſuppoſes God to leave a thing to His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to determine, of which their determination will be with leſſe honour to Himſelfe, leſſe good to their ſoules, leſſe comfort to their conſciences then if Himſelfe had determined it for them; is not to be credited or admitted without expreſſe Scripture for it. But to ſay, God hath left to every man ſingle the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his own neceſſary and ſufficient Times for Religion, is to ſuppoſe (and that without expreſſe Scripture) that He hath left to His ſervants to determine a thing, of which their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will be with leſſe honour to Himſelfe, leſſe good to their ſoules, leſſe comfort to their conſciences, then if Himſelfe had determined it for them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> without expreſſe Scripture for it, (which is not to be found) it is not to be credited or admitted, That God hath left this determination to every man ſingle.]</q> There needs, we conceive, no further words of this proofe.

                  <note place="margin">X. 3. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of agreement.</note>3.

And withall, that it is very conducible to the <hi>honour</hi> of God from all mankind, and to the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> all the world over, <q>[That all men ſhould have the ſame determinations for Continuance and Frequencie, and even for the ſame particular Day (as neere as may be) all the world over.]</q> Whence we frame this <hi>Syllogiſme:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>[That which ſuppoſes it extremely improbable, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible, That either God ſhould be generally honoured

by all mankind on the ſame dayes, and in like proportions; or the communion of Saints exerciſed ſo as it might be among all Gods people all the world over; or even that the help of thoſe that are neere one another ſhould be ſecured, and the hindrance prevented, is not to be credited or admitted.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> hath been confirmed before. The <hi>Minor</hi> is eaſily cleared. For how can it be imagined with any probability, or even poſſibility, <hi>[That every man having theſe Determinations left to him, all men every where will agree upon that ſame Continuance, Frequency, and particular day for Worſhip?]</hi> In what <hi>one</hi> thing do all <hi>men</hi> in all parts of the world agree, that is any way contrary to <hi>corrupted nature,</hi> as this <hi>determination</hi> of <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſufficient Time is:</hi> that is, contrary to the wills and carnall affections of men? Nay we need not travell ſo far for this, as all over the world. Take but any one country, city, village, houſe, and let it be but once known, that <hi>[None hath authority over another to determine times to him, but that it is left to every ſingle man for himſelf:]</hi> And it cannot reſonably be <hi>hoped,</hi> that there would be a compleat <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the ſame <hi>Proportions, Continuance,</hi> and <hi>Frequency,</hi> or the ſame <hi>particular dayes</hi> conſtantly. Some out of <hi>frowardneſſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not joyne with ſuch or ſuch, and would not have them joyne with themſelves, would have their <hi>dayes</hi> and <hi>times</hi> by themſelves. Others out of <hi>meere prophanneſſe,</hi> would ſhift and ſhuffle the <hi>times</hi> and <hi>dayes,</hi> that they might overſlip as much as they could. Others through <hi>covetouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>worldly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> love of <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and the like, would not think it fit to <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> themſelves long before hand, or to a <hi>conſtant proportion,</hi> or <hi>day:</hi> as not knowing what <hi>worldly occaſions</hi> they might have, which they had rather attend upon (though of no neceſſity) then upon Religion. And ſpecially, when by <hi>others</hi> being alſo left to their <hi>own determinations,</hi> they could not be certaine, whether they ſhould be <hi>interrupted</hi> by their comming to viſit them, or trade or trafficke with them. And ſo by the ſhift, beſides great neglect of <hi>Domeſticke</hi> and <hi>Solitary Worſhip,</hi> there would be in many places,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:112963:126"/>
even where <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were profeſſed, no <hi>Publique Worſhip,</hi> at all: or at leaſt, many would never come to it at all; or not in any <hi>conſtancy.</hi> And ſo this (together with the forenoted <hi>hindrances</hi> of the <hi>willing,</hi> by the <hi>interruptions</hi> of the untoward) would fill all places with nothing but <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>irreligion.</hi> And therefore cannot be ſuppoſed to be ſo left by God.</p>

                  <note place="margin">N.

it, becauſe to have <hi>obſerved</hi> it to their <hi>idols,</hi> and the honour, and worſhip of <hi>falſe gods,</hi> had been to have <hi>prophaned</hi> it, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath told us. Therefore alſo they are not <hi>reproved</hi> for not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any <hi>times</hi> at all; Yet doubtleſſe many of them were ſo <hi>Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi> and irreligious, as they obſerved not the <hi>times</hi> of their <hi>own Superſtition:</hi> Yet to obſerve <hi>ſome times,</hi> our <hi>adverſaries</hi> (and all men) confeſſe, is [<hi>abſolutely Morall Naturall, and bound all the Gentiles in all ages.</hi> But becauſe they obſerved not thoſe, they did <hi>obſerve,</hi> unto the honour of the <hi>true God,</hi> but of <hi>Idols,</hi> therefore we ſay they are never <hi>reproved</hi> for any neglect or <hi>inobſervation</hi> of <hi>Times</hi> at all. But on the otherſide, when God mentions by His Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chap. 56. <hi>[The ſonne of the ſtranger joyning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Lord,]</hi> He againe, and againe calls ſuch to the <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> with moſt ample <hi>promiſes,</hi> as a moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall part of <hi>Religion,</hi> and moſt <hi>neceſſary</hi> to every Servant of God.

                  <hi>maine branch,</hi> of our ſecond Argument: Namely, <hi>[That God hath not given Authority to any ſpeciall men, or number of men, to determine the chiefe Time of His Worſhip, for all men.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This queſtion is diſputable in three ſeverall <hi>diſtinctions of Time,</hi> or Ages of the World: The firſt we make, for this matter, from <hi>Adam,</hi> to the mention of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to Iſrael, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond from thence, to the making void of all the <hi>Jewiſh Dayes,</hi> the particular <hi>Seventh Day Sabbath</hi> and all; by the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and preaching of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> by the Apoſtles: The third from the making void of the <hi>old Seventh Day Sabbath</hi> to our Times, and ſo to <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſecond comming. And in each of theſe Periods of Times, Two ſorts of Perſons are generally conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 1. Thoſe that were <hi>out of the Church,</hi> by the <hi>revolt</hi> of their Anceſtours from Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall (intimated <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.) Namely, <hi>Cain</hi> and his poſterity, and thoſe that fell off to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. and thoſe of <hi>Noahs</hi> poſterity, that fell from the Covenant renewed with him, and <hi>Sem,</hi> (according to the intimations of <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.) Namely, the race of <hi>Cham,</hi> and even of <hi>Japhet,</hi> and <hi>Sem</hi> alſo, the moſt of them turning <hi>Idolaters,</hi> (as is ſaid even of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>Progenitours,</hi> before God called him, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24.2.) and ſo the greateſt part of the World remained, and doth remaine out of the Church, and <hi>Covenant</hi> of God to this Day, 2. In all ages from <hi>Adam,</hi> even untill now, God hath had a <hi>Church;</hi> ſome (though at Times very few) He <hi>renewed</hi> His <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> with, and made them His <hi>peculiar ſervants:</hi> And ſo were outwardly the <hi>whole Nation</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from their comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> till the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after their <hi>rejection</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> their promiſed <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And ever ſince, and a while before, He hath had a <hi>Church,</hi> chiefly out of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who have received His Goſpell, and the Faith of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Now we are to take a view of both theſe ſorts of men, the <hi>Pagans</hi> (ſo lets us for <hi>diſtinction</hi> ſake call the former ſort) and the <hi>Church,</hi> in the three Periods of Time forenoted. In all three of them it is controverted concerning the <hi>Pagans,</hi> what <hi>ſufficient Times</hi> they were obliged unto, or are, and by what Law, by whoſe <hi>determination.</hi> And for the <hi>Church</hi> or ſervants of God, in the firſt, and the laſt; for in the middlemoſt, it is beyond all peradventure, that God <hi>determined</hi> the <hi>Time</hi> to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and left it not to them:

                  <note place="margin">XV. 1.

               <p>And now againſt the <hi>Paganiſh Authority</hi> thus we diſpute. 1.<note place="margin">XVI. 1. By the importance.</note> By an Argument formerly uſed <q>[That which ſuppoſes God to leave a thing of exceeding importance in Religion, to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and judgements, of men devoid of conſcience, or true knowledge of God, to determine, not only for themſelves, but for all that are under them, is not to be credited or admitted.

And that is, <hi>(The determining the ſufficient Time of Worſhip, for all thoſe that are under them.)</hi> Concerning which, letting paſſe the conſideration of their <hi>Paganiſh inferiours;</hi> let us put the caſe (as it is the caſe really at this Day with ſundry <hi>Chriſtian Captives</hi> among the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> of <hi>Algiers</hi>) of any ſervant of God, living in a <hi>Paganiſh</hi> Country, and under the <hi>tyranny</hi> of an infidell Maſter or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Can it be ſuppoſed, that ſuch are <hi>bound</hi> to ſerve God and <hi>attend ſolemnely</hi> on Him, even in <hi>ſolitary</hi> Worſhip, (no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be had) and take care ſolemnely of their owne ſoules <hi>good;</hi> no other Time then their <hi>infidell</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Maſters and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours determine to them? Nay, we ſay rather, are they free and at liberty to <hi>attend</hi> on God and their ſoules no <hi>other Time,</hi> then what their <hi>Infidell</hi> and <hi>Pagan-governours</hi> determinations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them? (As ſuppoſe <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſold to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> and afterward the Jaylours ſervant in the priſon.) They know themſelves bound to ſerve their Maſters and Governours <hi>in all worldly ſervice,</hi> and bodily worke, and labour, every Day, and all the Day long, except
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:112963:129"/>
the neceſſary Times of naturall <hi>refreſhing,</hi> by ſleep, and eating, and the like; and the Times that muſt be tendred to God, (and for their ſoules good) in ſolemne Religious worſhip. Now if there be no ſuch <hi>determination</hi> of any <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to them, but only according to the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſuperiors: Is not this a <hi>bondage</hi> worſe then all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of their outward bondage? That though they have never ſo great deſire to <hi>waite ſolemnely</hi> upon God, they can have no <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> for it? Or though their ſoules need it never ſo much, (as they cannot, without <hi>miracle,</hi> but need it extremely, where ſpecially they have never any <hi>helpe</hi> from any <hi>publike</hi> or <hi>domeſtick</hi> worſhip, but all their <hi>good</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> muſt come from <hi>ſolitary</hi> worſhip) yet they cannot be allowed it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, upon this ſuppoſition of putting it over to their <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>profane</hi> maſters, hath in effect debarred them from <hi>taking</hi> any (and much more from <hi>determining</hi> any) to themſelves, without their <hi>Pagan-Superiors allowance.</hi> And if they ſhould offer it, they might be challenged with <hi>diſobedience,</hi> for not working continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>every Day,</hi> and <hi>all Day</hi> long, (as much as their <hi>naturall ſpirits</hi> could hold to) at their Superiors command: and might be urged with better reaſon, then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. 5. <hi>[You are idle, you are idle; therefore you ſay, let us go &amp; ſacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord our God]</hi> For they had Gods <hi>expreſſe command</hi> to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them: and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could not <hi>gainſay</hi> it, though he would not <hi>obey it.</hi> But here <hi>Pagan-Superiors</hi> have the full advantage of them, and have the Law (in a manner) wholly in their own hands, as having <hi>authority</hi> to command in all things, even this not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; Becauſe God hath put over this <hi>authority</hi> of determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expreſly of the <hi>Time ſufficient</hi> for His worſhip, to them. Now, unleſſe we can imagine, that God will ſo far ratifie this ſuppoſed <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>Pagan</hi> Governours in this matter, as to accept as <hi>ſufficient</hi> for His <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>bleſſe</hi> as ſufficient for His ſervants <hi>ſoules,</hi> any pittance of <hi>Time</hi> that they ſhall allow and determine, or rather which His ſervants can <hi>redeeme</hi> in any breathing times that they afford them in naturall reſpects; and ſo make any the leaſt proportion ſufficient: how can we ſay that God hath left the Determination of this ſufficient Time to Pagan Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours?</p>

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:112963:129"/>But we adde further, we muſt not admit the ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be varied: We propound the preſent Diſpute about the <hi>detetmination of this ſufficient Time,</hi> to whom it belongs; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it muſt of neceſſity be <hi>determined</hi> to <hi>Religion.</hi> Becauſe therefore, it is not to be believed, that <hi>Pagan-Governours</hi> will make this <hi>determination</hi> for their inferiors which are Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, (as experience alſo ſhewes in places where Chriſtians are now ſlaves) this <hi>determination</hi> muſt <hi>belong</hi> to ſome other then to them.

However, what day ſoever they took up, a <hi>ſober conſcience</hi> would (we think) ſhrinke to throw away the <hi>Lords day</hi> at a Pagans command. Let this we ſay, be conſidered. We on the other ſide being perſwaded, that <hi>God</hi> hath not only <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> us to <hi>one day in ſeven</hi> by the fourth Commandement, but to the <hi>Lords day,</hi> for the particular day, by thoſe <hi>deſignations</hi> of His word:

The <hi>Antecedent</hi> may alſo be fairely argued, from the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all bookes in this point: For though we know that <hi>Pagan Princes</hi> and ſtates did appoint ſome dayes extraordinarily, yet we find not that they did ſo ordinarily, nor ever thought they might doe ſo. But what was done in this kind, was from <hi>Oracles</hi> (or pretences of <hi>Oracles</hi>) of their gods, by their <hi>prieſts,</hi> or otherwiſe. And the greateſt <hi>flatterers</hi> of <hi>Pagan Princes,</hi> never did (that we remember) aſcribe this <hi>Authority</hi> to them, as given them by their gods. It were wonderfull then, that we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould find out this <hi>Authority</hi> given by God to <hi>Pagan Princes,</hi> of which (as we ſaid before) there is not the leaſt word, nor intimation; nor ſhadow of any ſuch thing in Scripture; and the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>

alſo is ſufficiently cleare againſt it. We conclude then, here the <hi>Authority</hi> is not, and yet upon divers ſuppoſitions of our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries</hi> touched already, and to be toucht hereafter, here it muſt be, or no where, among men, for thoſe that live in <hi>Pagan</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. For to come to the other ſort of men—</p>
               <p>That is, the <hi>Church of God,</hi> Of which we ſay, as before,<note place="margin">XXI. 2. Not to the Church for all mankind.</note>

[If the Church univerſall hath no Authority but ever her owne Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Then the Authority of determining the neceſſary and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Time for Religion, unto all men belongs not to the Church.

The Apoſtle denies any ſuch <hi>Authority</hi> to be in the <hi>Church</hi> of [<hi>Iudging thoſe that are without,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.] And if they cannot <hi>judge</hi> them, then not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> any thing to them: For this and that <hi>Authority</hi> goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in things determinable by the <hi>Church;</hi> Though the <hi>Church</hi> may <hi>judge,</hi> in things wherein it may not <hi>determine</hi> (in the ſence we now take <hi>determination</hi>) that is, the <hi>Church</hi> may <hi>cenſure,</hi> which is the <hi>judging</hi> there meant, <hi>offenders</hi> againſt Gods Law, as the inceſtuous Perſon ſpoken of.

It is leſſe then to <hi>determine</hi> and make Lawes, then to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>cenſure</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:112963:134"/>
offenders. The <hi>Church</hi> therefore having no power of <hi>cenſure,</hi> of thoſe without, thoſe that are not her <hi>Members,</hi> can have no <hi>power</hi> to <hi>determine</hi> any thing unto them. They, who are out of the Church, are already in as bad a condition, as the <hi>Churches cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> can make them, that can but deliver them to <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> undeniably hath them already. The <hi>Churches</hi> Authority is apparantly, but the <hi>Authority</hi> of a mother, now a <hi>mother,</hi> as a mother, hath no <hi>Authority</hi> over children, not her owne. 2. As alſo, becauſe it is, and would be extremly <hi>derogatory</hi> to the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> God hath given to Princes, Parents, Maſters, though <hi>Pagans;</hi> that any other men ſhould have (or be ſaid or thought to have) <hi>Authority</hi> to take away their ſubjects, children, ſervants, from their worke, under <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo many <hi>houres</hi> in a Day, or <hi>Dayes,</hi> in a Weeke, Moneth or Yeare. If God will doe it <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> (as we ſay He hath) there is no juſt ground of gainſaying, But for men to doe it, ſpecially who can ſhew no <hi>Title</hi> of any ſuch <hi>Authority</hi> committed to them, in their great Charter, of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> over <hi>Pagans,</hi> how unreaſonable is it to maintaine? Therefore the <hi>Church</hi> hath no ſuch <hi>Authority to determine Time for all men.</hi> And in <hi>concluſion</hi> there is none among mankind found, that have this <hi>Authority, for all men</hi> (for <hi>Pagans</hi> particularly) not every <hi>man</hi> ſingle, not <hi>Pagan-governours,</hi> for all under them: not the <hi>Church,</hi> for all men.

Arguments againſt the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the chief Time for all its members.</note>But becauſe our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> mainly build their conceits upon the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> over her <hi>owne,</hi> Members.

And doubt not to <hi>prove,</hi> what we have before aſſerted, <hi>[That the Church hath not this Authority given her by God, no not over her owne Members, to determine to them the chiefe Time of Worſhip, neceſſary and ordinarily ſufficient for the chiefe Time.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Arguments for this are divers. We begin with one <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall one,</hi> bordering upon our <hi>foregoing proofes,</hi> and reſting in part on them;</p>

all mankind that are out of the Church, Then God hath not left that determination of this Time, unto the Church for its Members: But the Scripture containes the determination of God at leaſt for all mankind, that are out of the Church.</hi> Ergo, <hi>God hath not left the determination of this Time unto the Church for its Members.]</hi> The <hi>conſequence,</hi> we conceive to be certaine; For that the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> are principally written to be <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Lawes</hi> to the Church; and ſo if they containe any Lawes for all the reſidue of mankind, then much more ſhall the ſame Lawes extend to them, and bind them. Many <hi>Lawes</hi> given to the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> did not bind the <hi>reſt of mankind abſolutely,</hi> that is, not till they entred into the Church, and ſo into the Covenant of God. They were not bound to the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> (nor admitted to it) till they <hi>yeelded</hi> themſelves, and all their <hi>males</hi> to be <hi>circumciſed:</hi> And no law commanded <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to take <hi>circumciſion</hi> upon them. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurian</hi> did not, though a <hi>man that feared God,</hi> Acts 10.11. And it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally held, that the <hi>Ceremonials</hi> and <hi>Judicials</hi> delivered particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (and not to other men before) bound only the <hi>Church</hi> of the Jewes, and willing <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to them: But no man ever ſaid yet, <hi>[That the Lawes expreſt in Scripture, binding all the reſt of Mankind, left the Church free, and bound not them: or that any one Law did ſo.]</hi> The <hi>Conſequence</hi> then is cleared.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> we take alſo to be undeniable upon the grounds laid: namely, <hi>[That the determination of this Time was not left to man, to every man ſingle, or any number of men for all the reſt: and ſo being to be made of neceſſity to Religion, by ſome or other, it was made by God.]</hi> And if made by God, then either 1. in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> (which we have alſo diſproved, and ſhewed, even with our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> conſent, who urge the ſame to ſerve their own turne, That the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> doth not make this <hi>determination:</hi>) Or elſe, 2. in <hi>Scripture;</hi> which then we ſay was, and is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all his <hi>poſterity,</hi> all mankind after him.

and his poſterity, and the reſt of <hi>Noahs</hi> poſterity, who revolted from the <hi>Church,</hi> and remained out of it: Revelations, we ſay, to theſe, of a <hi>determination</hi> made by God, of a <hi>proportion of Time,</hi> that even they were to <hi>obſerve:</hi> though no man can gueſſe any thing, what, or how, or when this was.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XXIII. An objection anſwered.</note>If it be objected, That this Argument will prove indeed, that the <hi>Time</hi> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. was <hi>determined to Adam,</hi> and all the Church under the Old Teſtament: But not that it remaines Gods <hi>determination</hi> under the New Teſtament: becauſe with the <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of the <hi>chief ſolemn Time for Continuance and Frequencie,</hi> namely, <hi>one whole Day in ſeven,</hi> to make up the <hi>chiefe Time neceſſary and ſufficient for all men;</hi> there was alſo unqueſtionably <hi>determined</hi> withall the <hi>particular Day,</hi> the ſeventh Day from the firſt Creation: and we do not urge that <hi>particular Day</hi> upon the <hi>Church;</hi> and therefore no more may we the other determination of <hi>one Day in ſeven</hi> for the <hi>chiefe Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We anſwer briefly, 1. We deny not, but the <hi>Pagans,</hi> thoſe that are out of the Church, and ſo know nothing of the change of that <hi>particular Day,</hi> ſtand bound ſtill to that <hi>particular Day,</hi> as well as to one Day in ſeven. 2. But yet we deny that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> doe ſo; becauſe they know, (and can ſhew) Gods <hi>expreſſe repeale</hi> in His Word; in the New Teſtament, of that <hi>particular Day;</hi> (we
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:112963:135"/>
ſay, of that <hi>particular Day,</hi> but not of the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequencie</hi> of one Day in ſeven for the <hi>chiefe Time</hi>) Of which we have already intimated faire Reaſons ſome; and ſhall handle it fully in its proper place. And withall they find a <hi>deſignation</hi> in Gods word, in the New Teſtament, of a <hi>new Day</hi> to <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> which <hi>Day</hi> alſo, by the former Arguments, of the Determinations belonging to God; and not to men; the <hi>Pagans,</hi> thoſe that are yet out of the <hi>Church,</hi> are bound to <hi>yield</hi> to, as ſoon as they know it out of Gods word. And therefore, 3. Alſo that <hi>Church,</hi> that hath the Word particularly written for them, are bound to the <hi>determinations</hi> therein expreſt; both for the <hi>chiefe Time neceſſary and ſufficient for Continuance and Frequencie,</hi> which is <hi>one whole Day</hi> in ſeven, according to the fourth Commandement: and for the <hi>particular Day,</hi> which is the <hi>firſt Day</hi> of the week, the <hi>Lords</hi> Day, according to the New Teſtament. We proceed to another Argument.</p>
               <p>And come more preſſely to <hi>oppoſe</hi> the Churches <hi>authority</hi> in this Determination.<note place="margin">XXIV. A caution premiſed.</note> And if herein we ſhall ſeem by ſome Arguments to ſhake the <hi>authority</hi> the Church is eſteemed to have in other things, or to favour the <hi>authority</hi> which is challenged by ſome to belong to <hi>particular Churches</hi> or Congregations. We deſire not to be miſtaken. For as we ſhall argue nothing upon this <hi>occaſion,</hi> but what we eſteeme to be both <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſecure fully this maineſt concernment of <hi>Religion,</hi> about the <hi>Determination</hi> of this <hi>chiefe Time</hi> for Gods <hi>honour,</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> of all mens ſoules: So to prevent all cauſeleſſe ſuſpitions, we profeſſe before-hand, fully and freely, 1. That we neither take the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to reſide chiefly in particular Congregations, (though ſomewhat more, we believe, belongs to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> then they have in ſome places been ſuffered to exerciſe) much leſſe that <hi>all the people</hi> have the <hi>rule</hi> in their hands, as the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> ſay; and leaſt of all, to take in <hi>women</hi> alſo, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi> doe. Though in the point in controverſie, we muſt needs aſſert the <hi>authority</hi> to determine this <hi>chiefe Time</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to belong to every <hi>particular Church</hi> or Congregation for themſelves, then to any ſuperior <hi>Governments</hi> or Governours to <hi>determine</hi> it for them; As we have already argued, that it rather <hi>belongs</hi> to every man and woman ſingle for themſelves, then to any
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:112963:136"/>
                  <hi>number</hi> of men for all the reſt. Therefore againe we profeſſe, that in thoſe matters wherein the <hi>Church</hi> hath <hi>authority,</hi> the <hi>authority</hi> is in the <hi>Church-Governours,</hi> not in the whole body; and greater authority in ſuperior <hi>Governments,</hi> as in <hi>Synods</hi> Provinciall and Nationall, together with the authority of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate; moſt of all in Generall <hi>Councels,</hi> (or ſuch a <hi>Councell</hi> as is of many <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations together) called by the conſent of <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> and States. 2. That we are perſwaded, the <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church have ſome <hi>authority,</hi> even <hi>legiſlative,</hi> in ſome matters (as far as the Scripture-rules admit) namely, <hi>[That all things be done to edification, and decently, and in order, and with charity, and which may make for peace:]</hi> that is, in matters <hi>indifferent</hi> (as they are commonly called) in things wherein God hath not <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> this way, or that way preciſely; and ſo are matters of ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler concernment, which may admit of variation in divers <hi>Churches</hi> at the ſame time, and in the ſame <hi>Church</hi> at divers times; and wherein the main concernments of <hi>Religion,</hi> Gods <hi>honour,</hi> and the ſoules <hi>good,</hi> or even mens outward <hi>bodily neceſſities</hi> are not prejudiced: as they may be on either hand, undeniably, by an <hi>unneceſſary</hi> or <hi>unſufficient determination</hi> of the <hi>Time</hi> we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. Theſe things thus <hi>cautioned,</hi> we proceed to our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which will be numerous, and we ſuppoſe waighty, every one of them: whereby we ſhall evince both the falſeneſſe of our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> aſſertion of the <hi>Churches</hi> authority in this matter: as alſo diſcover unto the obſervant Reader, how <hi>negligently</hi> and careleſly they have hitherto handled this point about the <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of this <hi>neceſſary-ſufficient-chiefe Time for Religion</hi> by the Churches <hi>authority;</hi> as if they had had to do with men that would take their <hi>dictates</hi> for <hi>oracles,</hi> and never require <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in moſt important difficulties, which attend their Poſitions and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Our next Argument is this.</p>

                  <hi>[If the Church have authority to determine unto its members the neceſſary and ordinarily ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion, then it hath authority to make that Time neceſſary to Religion, by vertue of its determination, which was not neceſſary before us determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:112963:136"/>
to determine to its members the neceſſary ordinarily ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and chiefe Time for Religion.]</hi> The <hi>Conſequence</hi> cannot juſtly be rejected: For the <hi>authority</hi> we are diſputing about, is a <hi>legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> authority, and that concerning a <hi>Time neceſſary</hi> for <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> which <hi>authority</hi> God had unqueſtionably in His hands of old; and whatſoever <hi>Time</hi> He determined, was <hi>neceſſary</hi> unto Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even by vertue of His <hi>determination.</hi> Now we ſay, we are diſputing of this <hi>authority,</hi> Whether this be put over to the <hi>Church,</hi> or not, becauſe ſuch a determination muſt be (as we have ſhewed) of <hi>a Time neceſſary unto Religion:</hi> Therefore if the <hi>Church</hi> have the <hi>authority</hi> to determine this Time, (to make this determination) It hath <hi>authority</hi> to make that <hi>neceſſary</hi> by vertue of its determination, which before its determination was not <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> For if it were neceſſary before, then the Church doth not make the <hi>determination,</hi> or exerciſe a <hi>legiſlative authority;</hi> but only doe a <hi>prudentiall act,</hi> or miniſteriall, to declare and preach to its members, what Time <hi>God,</hi> in Nature or Scripture, hath made <hi>neceſſary;</hi> not determining, we ſay, any thing, by vertue of any <hi>authority</hi> given to it in that caſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is no leſſe certaine divers wayes. 1. Becauſe, if the Church could make a <hi>Time neceſſary,</hi> which was not before <hi>neceſſary</hi> by vertue of its determination; then it could make <hi>any Time</hi> it ſhould determine, <hi>neceſſary</hi> by vertue of its determination, (for, <hi>A quatenus ad omus valet conſequentia</hi>) the authority,<note place="margin">To the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this Antecedent, See hereafter a diſtinct Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe Times only neceſſary to Religion, which G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Therefore it remaines, that the Church cannot make a Time <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Religion by vertue of its determination, which was not <hi>neceſſary</hi> before. 2. To make a thing neceſſary to Religion, which was not before neceſſary, is to have <hi>power</hi> upon the Conſcience: But the Church hath no power upon the Conſcience, to make Lawes, and impoſe them upon mens Conſciences: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church cannot make a thing neceſſary to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:112963:137"/>
Religion, which was not before neceſſary; and ſo not make <hi>Time neceſſary.</hi> 3. The <hi>Churches authority,</hi> generally is acknowledged, not to extend beyond things <hi>indifferent:</hi> But to make a thing, or <hi>Time, neceſſary</hi> to Religion, which before was not neceſſary, is to go beyond the limits of things <hi>indifferent. Ergo,</hi> the Churches <hi>authority</hi> extends not, to make a <hi>Time neceſſary</hi> to Religion, which before was not <hi>neceſſary:</hi> and ſo not to <hi>meddle</hi> with determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>neceſſary chiefe Time,</hi> which muſt be determined for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XXVI. Argument third. The Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make Time ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>A third argument followes paralell to this <hi>[If the Church have authority to determine to its members the neceſſary, and ordinarily ſufficient chiefe Solemne Time for Religion; then it hath authority to make that Time, ordinarily ſufficient, for the chiefe Time for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by vertue of its determination, which before its determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was not ſufficient. But the Church hath no authority to make, by vertue of its determination, that Time ſufficient ordinarily for the chiefe Time for Religion, which before its determination was not ſufficient.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Church hath no authority to determine to its members, the neceſſary and ordinarily ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion.]</hi> The <hi>conſequence</hi> is again cleare from the former <hi>grounds.</hi> We are now arguing about a <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, <hi>ordinarily ſufficient,</hi> 1. for Gods <hi>honour,</hi> in His <hi>approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>acceptance;</hi> 2. <hi>Sufficient</hi> for mens ſoules, in Gods bleſſing: And 3. Sufficient for <hi>ſober conſciences</hi> ſatisfaction, in reference to a juſt ground of perſwaſion of both the former. Now God had of old in His hands, <hi>authority</hi> unqueſtionable to determine ſuch a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Time;</hi> and to make any <hi>Time</hi> ſufficient, ſo far as His deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination intended it; even by vertue of His determination of it. And, we are, we ſay, diſputing now: whether this <hi>authority</hi> be put over to the <hi>Church</hi> or not? Becauſe ſuch a determination, muſt ſtill be (as we have alſo ſhewed) of a <hi>chiefe Time, ſufficient unto Religion;</hi> that is, ordinarily ſufficient, and for the <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> in all the forenoted regards. Therefore if the <hi>Church</hi> have <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to determine this <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> (to make this determination,) it hath authority to make that <hi>Time ſufficient</hi> by vertue of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, which before was not <hi>ſufficient.</hi> For if it were <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> before, then the <hi>Church</hi> doth not properly make the <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> but only declare it; It doth not exerciſe any <hi>legiſlative
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:112963:137"/>
act</hi> but only prudentiall and miniſteriall; It only preaches to its members what <hi>Times</hi> God in <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>Scripture</hi> hath made <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient:</hi> not determining any thing <hi>deciſively,</hi> by vertue of any <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> given it in the caſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is alſo again divers wayes confirmed. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the <hi>Church</hi> could make a <hi>Time ſufficient</hi> unto Religion by vertue of its <hi>authority</hi> or determination, which before was not <hi>ſufficient;</hi> then it could make any <hi>Time,</hi> that it ſhould determine, <hi>ſufficient</hi> by vertue of the ſame authority and determination; (for again <hi>A quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia;</hi>) the <hi>authority,</hi> and ſo the vertue of it, being the ſame in one determination, as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And then <hi>one houre</hi> in a weeke, or two houres in a <hi>Moneth,</hi> or in a <hi>yeere,</hi> or any other <hi>proportion</hi> or <hi>number,</hi> would be <hi>ſufficient</hi> unto Religion, if the Church ſhould ſo <hi>determine</hi> it. But this alſo, cannot be denyed to be moſt abſurd. Therefore it remaines that the <hi>Church</hi> cannot make a <hi>Time ſufficient</hi> unto Religion, by vertue of its <hi>authority</hi> and determination, which was not <hi>ſufficient</hi> before. 2. To make a <hi>Time ſufficient</hi> to Gods <hi>honour,</hi> in His <hi>acceptation,</hi> is His own <hi>Royall Prerogative:</hi> according to his own expreſſion of His <hi>approbation.</hi> But this He hath not communicated to the <hi>Church</hi> in any thing whatſoever,<note place="margin">Of Gods bleſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make the Time ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct proofe. <hi>Sect.</hi> 71.</note> for the <hi>maine</hi> and chiefe part of it. And therefore not in this <hi>matter,</hi> hath he given the <hi>Church au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> having no where confined His <hi>approbation</hi> to the <hi>Churches</hi> determination. 3. To make a thing <hi>ſufficient to the ſoules of men in Gods bleſſing,</hi> is alſo a peculiar of His Almighty grace. And He hath not given the <hi>Church</hi> power, to convey in any other thing, His Heavenly Grace, at their pleaſure. And therefore not in this matter of <hi>Time.</hi> 4. The <hi>Churches authority</hi> (as we ſaid before) is generally acknowledged not to reach beyond things <hi>indifferent.</hi> But to make a <hi>Time ſufficient for Religion,</hi> which before was not ſufficient, exceeds the limits of things <hi>indefferent. Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> hath no ſuch <hi>authority.</hi> 5. To make a thing <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſatisfy <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber conſciences,</hi> in reference to a juſt ground of perſwaſion of Gods <hi>acceptation</hi> and <hi>bleſſing,</hi> there can be no leſſe then an <hi>impoſſibility</hi> of errour, in the determining the proportion, and the diſtribution of it, between the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequency.</hi> But this God hath no where promiſed to the Church in any matter (that is, to no <hi>number</hi> of men, outwardly profeſſing themſelves to be the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:112963:138"/>
Church) except only to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Neither doe our <hi>Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in this point ſo much as pretend an <hi>impoſſibilitie</hi> of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches erring, (as appeares even by their arguing that the Church may <hi>alter</hi> the determination, after it is made.) Therefore we ſay againe, and conclude, that the Churches determination or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity cannot make a <hi>Time,</hi> which before was not <hi>ſufficient,</hi> to be ſufficient to ſatisfie any <hi>ſober conſcience;</hi> and ſo no way <hi>ſufficient</hi> for Religion.</p>

An Exception anſwered.</note>We are not ignorant, that to both theſe foregoing Arguments about the <hi>neceſſitie and ſufficiencie</hi> of this <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> there may be ſome kind of Anſwer made out of the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> books: Namely, that they argue not, that the Church hath <hi>authoritie</hi> to <hi>determine</hi> ſo <hi>exceſſively much,</hi> or ſo <hi>remarkably little.</hi> But they come, for the <hi>Frequencie,</hi> towards <hi>one Day in ſeven,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almoſt home to it, ſaying, it muſt not be <hi>leſſe then one in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Only they ſtill keep aloofe off in the point of <hi>Continuance,</hi> which yet (as hath been oft noted, and hath need to be oft repeated and remembred) is the main ſubject of all the <hi>diſpute</hi> and quarrell between them and us: In this they dare not yet, at leaſt have not ſpoken out, what <hi>Continuance,</hi> or neere what, the Church ſhould determine, no not for the <hi>Publike Worſhip,</hi> (except the Author of <hi>Sunday no Sabbath,</hi> that mentions two houres.) But even about the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>one Day in ſeven,</hi> they are not conſtant, but flie off againe ſomtimes a great way, as afraid to grant ſo often by way of <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or aſſert ſo often by way of <hi>ſufficiencie,</hi> leſt they ſhould be put to prove it; and then the <hi>fourth Commandement</hi> (which they like not, becauſe it would tie them to a <hi>whole Daies continuance</hi>) would be their only ſufficient refuge. Therefore alſo their Reaſons are very doubtfully and waveringly propounded. And ſo we eſteeme, that ſuch an Anſwer is over <hi>ambiguous</hi> to be ſufficient to ſatisfie either of our Arguments. And if they will hereafter (or any for them) offer to make an anſwer definitely and clearely, either to the <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> or <hi>ſufficiencie</hi> of the <hi>proportion;</hi> Let them have but <hi>one Day</hi> of ten, or twenty as <hi>neceſsary,</hi> and two houres of that Day; or nominate thoſe, or any other proportions of <hi>Frequencie</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> as ſufficient: Whatever they inſtance in, (and whether it be well or ill) yet will it ſuffice for our Arguments, to juſtifie them, and confirm, that the Church hath no abſolute, or <hi>legiſlative

authoritie</hi> to determine this <hi>chiefe Time neceſsary and ſufficient to Religion.</hi> But that Nature, and Reaſon, or Scripture, ſome, or all of theſe, doe before-hand determine the <hi>neceſſitie</hi> and <hi>ſufficiencie</hi> of it. And that the Churches office herein is no more but of a Cryer, or Preacher, (as our Divines urge againſt the Papiſts, in point of the Churches authority to determine what <hi>Bookes</hi> are the Word of God) to declare and pronounce, and then conſequently to uſe her authority over her members, to urge them to the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, as much as may be: and not at all of a <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it. And thus much, we verily beleeve, theſe Arguments have evinced undeniably. Which therefore we againe deſire our <hi>Readers</hi> to obſerve, that ſo the Churches abſolute and unlimited <hi>authority</hi> may be no more urged in this controverſie, no not in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall (and ſo deceivable) termes. And then we doubt not, but many Readers will ſoone ſee a <hi>neceſſity</hi> to have recourſe to the fourth Commandement, as Gods own <hi>determination</hi> of this <hi>neceſſary</hi> and ſufficient <hi>chiefe Time</hi> for <hi>Continuance,</hi> a whole Day, for <hi>Frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> one in ſeven, as the only ſure ground for conſciences to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſo important a matter. And that many more, (not to ſay all, that are not ſwallowed up with prejudices) will be of the ſame mind, when we have expreſly diſcuſſed, whether the Churches wiſdome will or can ſuffice to determine from Nature and Reaſon, and any thing in Scripture (beſides the preciſe <hi>determination of one Day</hi> in ſeven, according to that fourth Commandement) the juſt proportion of <hi>neceſſarie and ſufficient Time for Religion.</hi> Which we ſhall take to taske, ere we make an end of this queſtion in this Chapter. In the meane Time, we goe on to a fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>[<hi>If the Church have Authority to determine the chiefe Time for all its Members,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">XXVIII. Argument 4. The Church cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Time for family, or ſolitary Worſhip.</note> 
                  <hi>then it hath Authority to determine the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſo laregly to extend beyond the Publike Worſhip, even to take in both domeſtick Worſhip where it may be had, and ſpecially ſolitary Worſhip, by every Chriſtian apart, before and after the Publike Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:112963:139"/>
Time for all its Members.]</hi> The <hi>conſequence</hi> hath beene proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at large, in the former Chapter, that the <hi>Continuance</hi> of the <hi>chiefe Time</hi> muſt be ſo large, as not only to <hi>allow,</hi> but to <hi>neceſſitate</hi> before and after the <hi>publike Worſhip, family Worſhip</hi> alſo, where it may be had, and however to neceſſitate, as well as to <hi>afford</hi> liberty for <hi>ſolitary Worſhip</hi> by every one apart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> may be thus ſtrengthned. 1. It is uſually ſaid <hi>[That the ſword, nor the keyes, meddle not within doores]</hi> that is, Neither the Civill <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> nor the <hi>Church-governours,</hi> take upon them to make affirmative Lawes for private <hi>families</hi> (for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative they doe) in reference to what they doe among themſelves, not <hi>directly</hi> concerning the ſervice of the Church or State: And leaſt of all, do they <hi>meddle</hi> with their <hi>Time;</hi> of which every <hi>gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of a family is counted Lord and Maſter, or Lady and Miſtris, for themſelves and all under their authority. Even when a man is bound by <hi>Indentures</hi> to teach his apprentiſe his trade, yet not at this Time, or that Time, or ſo long together. Therefore we find not that any <hi>Church,</hi> or Chriſtian <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> though forbidding worke to all even within doores, upon ſuch and ſuch Dayes, hath yet commanded Parents or Maſters to catechiſe their children, and ſervants, within doores on thoſe Dayes preciſely, or <hi>pray</hi> with them, or <hi>examine</hi> them what they have learned in publike, or any ſuch like <hi>Duties</hi> of Religion. 2. But ſpecially in reference to <hi>ſolitary Worſhip,</hi> ſecret prayers, ſecret thankſgivings, ſecret medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the word heard, or of any other heavenly and divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, concerning <hi>God</hi> and the ſoule; The <hi>Church</hi> hath no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to determine any <hi>Time,</hi> which neceſſarily muſt be ſpent in any of theſe <hi>Duties,</hi> or any other in ſecret. Of which we conceive a double reaſon. 1. Becauſe no authority of man is ſuppoſed to reach to that which neither themſelves nor any other man living can ever come to know, whether it be obſerved or not. Which is the caſe plainly here, No man can know (nor all the men in World) when I <hi>retire</hi> my ſelfe any Day, and ſhut my ſelfe up in my chamber, whether I <hi>pray</hi> or meditate, or performe any other <hi>ſolitary Worſhip</hi> to God, or not: Unleſſe I tell them afterward, or ſpeake ſo loud, as that they over-hear me, which I am not bound to doe, or rather, am bound not to doe. It is altogether vaine (to ſay no more) to <hi>determine</hi> and command that which no <hi>account</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:112963:139"/>
can be taken of by thoſe that command it, or by any man elſe, whether it be obeyed or not. 2. But further, <hi>ſecret Duties,</hi> and ſo <hi>Time</hi> to be neceſſarily imployed in them, are immediately <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of conſcience, even the moſt inward and ſpirituall that can be. Now no <hi>authority</hi> of man, of the Church, or any other, reaches <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> to the conſcience, and the inward and ſpirituall part of <hi>Duties;</hi> But only the <hi>Authority</hi> of God alone. Here againe the Church or any ſuperiour may give <hi>Counſell,</hi> or declare the <hi>will</hi> of God about ſuch <hi>Duties,</hi> or ſuch <hi>Time</hi> to be ſo imployed; But can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command or determine it, Whereas we are ſpeaking of a <hi>Time</hi> that muſt be <hi>determined,</hi> of which therefore the Church hath no <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be objected, that the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">XXIX. An Exception anſwered.</note> or the Church hath <hi>authority</hi> to appoint a publike <hi>Day of Faſting</hi> and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this to be ſpent in <hi>Religious Duties,</hi> as well <hi>private</hi> as <hi>publike,</hi> till the end of the Day; and if ſo, why not for the ordinary chiefe ſolemne Time?</p>
               <p>We Anſwer in a word,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that the <hi>Continuance</hi> of a <hi>publike Faſt</hi> is before hand determined by God in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the buſineſſe, to <hi>a whole Day,</hi> and no leſſe <hi>Continuance,</hi> (neither did ever any <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Church ſpeake otherwiſe of it, though we know the <hi>Popiſh mock-faſts,</hi> or <hi>foole faſts,</hi> end often at noone) ſo that all that the Church doth, or the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, is to appoint and determine the <hi>particular Day,</hi> or the <hi>Frequency</hi> of Dayes, upon ſome ſpeciall occaſions; and to declare that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> is to be extended ſo long, with <hi>penalties</hi> Civil or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall on them that ſhall be knowne to tranſgreſſe it, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doores, otherwiſe they doe not command properly any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>family, or ſolitary Worſhip</hi> at all: Or if they did, were it not for thoſe intimations of Scripture, and the <hi>Nature</hi> of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of <hi>ſolemne humiliation,</hi> (and the prevention of all tolerable ordinary excuſes by the publike appointment) no mans <hi>conſcience</hi> were bound to obſerve the <hi>whole Day,</hi> at home, and in <hi>ſolitary Worſhip,</hi> before and after the publike, becauſe of the Churches, or Magiſtrates <hi>authority</hi> and determination, for the reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet downe.

acquaintance</hi> had not a <hi>piece of roaſt or baked meat to a Sundaies-dinner, throughout the whole yeere,</hi> which muſt needs be becauſe all the <hi>ſervants</hi> went conſtantly to the <hi>publike worſhip.</hi> An <hi>imputation</hi> (to ſay no leſſe of it) worthy the pen of one of thoſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. <hi>whoſe God is their belly:</hi> otherwiſe, how durſt he that would carry the <hi>face</hi> of a Chriſtian, reproach the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt (as he there doth) for teaching the people, both Maſters, and ſervants, to preferre the <hi>publike worſhip</hi> of God, before the <hi>ſacrificing</hi> to their owne bellies, and ſo to take more care, even of every poore ſervants ſoule, by carrying them along to the <hi>publike worſhip</hi> of God, then to provide for the pampering of their owne guts, though with the pinching or ſtarving of their ſervants ſoules. But to let him paſſe, we urge all of them, (and ſpecially thoſe that diſpute, that the fourth Commandement was not given to ſervants) whether they will averre, <hi>[That a ſervant is bound by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches determination, to keepe conſtantly to the publike worſhip, from the firſt to the laſt of it, every time that there is any]</hi> Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any Commandement to the contrary?

Who hath a ſoule to ſave, and ſo to looke after, and a deſire to uſe the meanes for it, ſpecially Gods publike worſhip; having little or no helpe at all (but hindrance rather) in the family, and exceeding little time for any ſolitary devotions? They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here anſwer either way, but they overthrow their owne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. For either 1. They muſt ſay, <hi>[Servants and inferiours may, and muſt keepe ſtrictly to the Churches determinations for publike worſhip, notwithſtanding any contrary command, or threatning, or cruelty of their ungodly ſuperiours;]</hi> Which they will not allow us to urge men to, upon the Commandement and determination of God Himſelfe; and for this, they deny this Commandement of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to have layen upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Egypt; and that the

                  </note> that the Church was at liberty whether it would have determined ſo much, or not.

termes. 2. And then they muſt ſay, that it is unlawfull for the Church to determine a <hi>whole Day:</hi> which they cannot well doe, conſidering 1. that a <hi>whole Day</hi> may be lawfully obſerved, by their own confeſſions; and they uſually hold, that what a man may doe <hi>voluntarily,</hi> the Church may enjoyne to doe. Alſo, 2. we have argued <hi>one Day</hi> at leaſt in ones life to be <hi>Morall-Naturall,</hi> and therefore God doth not, in likelihood, refuſe the determination of a <hi>whole Day</hi> in a convenient <hi>Frequencie.</hi> As likewiſe, 3. We have ſhewed, that a whole Dayes <hi>Continuance,</hi> in a convenient <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie,</hi> is clearly the moſt <hi>profitable diſtribution</hi> of the proportion for the <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> and far more advantagious both for Religion, and worldly buſineſſe, then a leſſe <hi>Continuance</hi> with a more <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Revolution.</hi> There is no probability therefore at all, (unleſſe there were a <hi>certaine word</hi> for it in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which there is not) that God ſhould allow the Church liberty to determine the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> any other way, and not allow the determination to a whole Day. 5. Yet againe, if ſo, This may be ſatisfied with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining it to begin within a quarter of an houre of every ones waking, and to continue till within a quarter of an houre of their lying down to ſleep, (or of midnight) and what <hi>remarkable liberty</hi> were this, to be granted as a ſpirituall priviledge, and purchaſed by the <hi>blood</hi> of our Redeemer? (as they ſometimes ſpeake to us in <hi>ſcorne,</hi> when we name ſome few reſtraints on the <hi>weekly Sabbath</hi> to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which we are now freed from.) 6. But above all, we deſire the Chriſtian Reader to conſider two things more: the <hi>one</hi> is, how that can be called a ſpirituall priviledge, or <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> if the Church have authority to determine remarkably <hi>leſſe Frequencie,</hi> or ſpecially <hi>leſſe Continuance</hi> then God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to the Jewes? Remarkably leſſe then a Day? When the <hi>ſoules</hi> of Chriſtians are toyled with worldly buſineſſes all the week long, and almoſt <hi>over grown</hi> with the thornes of worldly cares and diſtractions, through multitude of imployments, ſpecially being <hi>ſervants</hi> and inferiors, or men of great <hi>trading,</hi> or of much <hi>buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> even in publike affaires, as great Stateſmen; and they long for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the chiefe ſolemne Time, that they may have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to breath toward God, and refreſh their ſoules with converſe with Him, in <hi>Publike, Domeſtick,</hi> and <hi>Solitary</hi> worſhip; and ſo provide for <hi>Eternity,</hi> ſpecially that Day, all other Dayes being
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:112963:143"/>
ſo much taken up with temporall and earthly matters: And now the Time is ſo ſhort by a ſcanty <hi>determination,</hi> that ſpecially as ſoon as the <hi>Publike Worſhip</hi> is over, they are againe called upon by their <hi>earthly buſineſſes,</hi> and forced to their worldly drudgery again (as their ſpirituall ſoules will call it) even by others <hi>importunities</hi> and haunting them, ſpecially themſelves being inferiors. Is this, we ſay, a ſpirituall priviledge, a <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> for which the blood of the bleſſed Redeemer was (in part) ſhed to purchaſe it? What our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> conſciences (when they doe more ſeriouſly to conſider it in cold blood, then perhaps they ever yet have done hitherto) will judge of this, we know not. But for our own parts, we are ſo far from counting or calling this a <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> that we eſteem it were a miſerable ſlaverie and bondage to ſoules and conſciences. And ſo contradictory expreſly to the <hi>gracious intents</hi> of our moſt <hi>gracious Redeemer,</hi> whoſe blood hath procured us all advantages to our ſoules that can juſtly be deſired, and in no wiſe left us in worſe condition for our <hi>ſoules good,</hi> then the Jews were. And we doubt not but the conſcientious Readers will be greatly of our minds. We wiſh our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> ſadly to conſider it. 7. The <hi>other</hi> Conſideration is, That if a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a ſcanty determination of the Church in the point of <hi>Continuance,</hi> whether ſuperior or inferior, (but ſpecially if an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior) Or even in the caſe of obſervation of whatſoever <hi>Time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> by the Church, be it more or leſſe, oftener or ſeldomer; ſhall in their <hi>voluntary</hi> obſervation of any other Time, or in their <hi>obedientiall</hi> obſervation of their <hi>determined Time,</hi> be encountred with froward interruptions, (though not of neceſſity ſufficient to be yeelded to by Gods reſervations) or ſpecially be commanded, or threatned, or miſuſed by Maſters, or Parents in oppoſition to it; Were it to be counted a <hi>ſpirituall priviledge</hi> to have no better ground of <hi>ſuffering,</hi> then the <hi>Churches</hi> determination? Were this to be reputed a <hi>Chriſtian liberty</hi> purchaſed by the blood of our divine Redeemer? (by the blood of God, as it is <hi>Act.</hi> 20.) Or rather an <hi>unhappy want</hi> of a firme foundation of confidence in ſuffering? Wherein Chriſtians having the expreſſe word of God determining them to this (whatever it be) of <hi>Time</hi> which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, they may juſtly <hi>triumph</hi> and rejoice in any loſſe, or reproach, or ſuffering whatſoever. We conclude then, We diſcerne nothing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:112963:144"/>
leſſe then a <hi>ſpirituall priviledge</hi> or Chriſtian liberty, for this <hi>chiefe neceſſary and ſufficient Time</hi> for Religion to be left to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches determination. And therefore we ſay, doubtleſſe, ſuch <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of determination was not left to the Church.</p>

                  <hi>We argue yet againe in the eighth place, [If this authority of determining the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe ſolemn Time for Religion, unto its members, be left to the Church; Then is a matter of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance in Religion left by God to manifold great uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, even among Chriſtians.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> needs little proofe. He ſhould be very auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that ſhould offer to condemne, not onely ſome Generall Councells, but all; and not only in one age, but ever ſince the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> Times, and the <hi>univerſall Church</hi> withall, as not endevouring the amendment of a notorious fault, as we ſhall ſee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:112963:146"/>The <hi>aſſumption</hi> may be verified, by declaring 1. That if the Church univerſall have not by ſome Generall Councell, made a cleare and expreſſe determination of this <hi>neceſſary ſufficient Time,</hi> It cannot be excuſed of grievous ſin, upon this ſuppoſition of this <hi>authority</hi> belonging to the Church. 2. That the Church univerſall hath not to this day, in any Generall <hi>Councell</hi> made any cleare and ſufficient <hi>determination</hi> in this kind.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe cannot well be denyed. For this were to be wanting to a <hi>duty</hi> moſt mainly concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and His <hi>honour</hi> throughout the Church, and the <hi>good</hi> of all Chriſtians ſoules, and to a <hi>law Morall Naturall,</hi> as appeares by what our <hi>adverſaries</hi> confeſſe of the <hi>morality</hi> of a <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> to be determined, (even ſuppoſe, but for the <hi>Publique Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>) and as we have proved the neceſſity of ſuch a <hi>determination</hi> to Religion to be made by ſome or other; and ſo by the Church, the Church univerſall, if the authority belongs to them. And to <hi>omit</hi> it, though upon miſtake, and not thinking it to belong to them, were to be <hi>guilty</hi> of ſin, though a leſſe ſin (namely, only of <hi>Ignorance,</hi>) then if through <hi>negligence,</hi> or any other reſpect, ſo many <hi>Generall Councells</hi> have forborne to make it: For that were to ſlight <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>honour</hi> of God, the <hi>ſoules</hi> of Chriſtians, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly: which doubtleſſe, the Chriſtian Church, and the firſt Generall <hi>Councells</hi> were not guilty of.</p>
               <p>But yet the ſecond is evident enough, that no <hi>Generall Councell</hi> hath made this determination: Not onely becauſe no ſuch Canon is to be found in any of them to this purpoſe, no not ſo much as for any thing of it; not for the <hi>particular day;</hi> (though of this, the <hi>Laodicean Councell,</hi> which was provinciall, ſpeakes plainly, as we ſhall heare hereafter,) much leſſe, for the <hi>Frequency,</hi> and leaſt of all for the <hi>Continuance.</hi> As alſo becauſe our <hi>adverſaries</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe much to <hi>Generall Councells,</hi> yet diſpute one while againſt the <hi>Day,</hi> as changeable by the preſent Church, another while againſt the <hi>number,</hi> that it may be one of eight, or of ſix, or of ſome other number: But ſpecially againſt the <hi>Continuance</hi> (againſt which indeed their greateſt ſpight is.) And when we alledge any <hi>Provinciall</hi> or Nationall Councells, averring the <hi>Divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and the <hi>totall</hi> ſanctification of it, and ſo making <hi>Canons,</hi> not to ordaine, but to confirme thoſe <hi>determinations,</hi> they
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:112963:147"/>
reject them as but <hi>partiall Authorities,</hi> and not as ſpeaking the ſence of the <hi>Church univerſall.</hi> Therefore we ſay again, the <hi>Church univerſall,</hi> either took it for granted (in all the <hi>Generall Councells</hi>) that thoſe <hi>determinations</hi> were already made to their hands by God and His word, in the Old and New Teſtaments; and that Chriſtians generally did acknowledge and obſerve them: or elſe it ſinned in not ſufficiently <hi>diſcharging</hi> the <hi>truſt</hi> committed to it about this determination, in not making it <hi>expreſly,</hi> or not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it clearely to poſterity. If they took the matter to be of no importance, they ſinned undeniably in ſo undervaluing it. If they took it to be of <hi>importance,</hi> and yet took no care of it, they ſinned yet more. What remaines then, but that the very <hi>ſilence</hi> of the Church univerſall in ſo many <hi>Generall Councells</hi> as have been held from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Time, proclaimes that they eſteemed it (as ſundry provinciall <hi>Councells</hi> ſpeake, we ſhall heare) concluded before by God and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the word; and found it in the common acknowledgment and <hi>practiſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Which as it decayed any where, the provinciall and nationall <hi>Councells</hi> took order to declare the truth; and make <hi>ſanctions</hi> for a more conſcionable obſervation. And we for our parts cannot think otherwiſe, but that God in His providence ſo diſpoſed of it, that no <hi>Generall Councell</hi> ſhould take upon them to meddle with this determination; leaſt their <hi>Injunctions,</hi> only for <hi>confirmation,</hi> ſhould be miſſe-interpreted to be an <hi>inſtitution,</hi> and a <hi>determination:</hi> (as ſome of our diſputers do almoſt make as much of a conſtitution of <hi>Conſtantines,</hi> for the <hi>obſervation</hi> of the <hi>Lords day;</hi>) But hereby he hath the more fully and manifeſtly reſerved the <hi>authority</hi> to himſelf, and to be ſought for in His written word.</p>

                  <note place="margin">XLII. Arg. 10.

               <p>
                  <hi>If the determination of the neceſſary ſufficient Time for Religion belong to the Church, then it belonged to the Apoſtles and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church Governours, to make it for all Chriſtians.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:112963:147"/>
The <hi>conſequence</hi> cannot be denyed, for no ſucceeding generation of the Church can have this authority, no not for their own age, if the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Pimitive Church Governours had it not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is thus confirmed. <hi>[That authority which they did not practiſe in a matter of greateſt importance to Religion, the Apoſtles and Primitive Church had not.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denyed without <hi>charging</hi> the whole Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, and then all the Apoſtles alſo with grievous ſinne. The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus further confirmed. <hi>[That which the Apoſtles did in all matters of great importance to Religion, they left cleare and ſufficient record of, for the practiſe of Chriſtians.

Our <hi>adverſaries</hi> take paines to prove (and we ſtick not to grant them) that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have not in <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor any where elſe, left any cleare ſufficient <hi>authenticke record</hi> of any <hi>determination</hi> of theirs in either of theſe reſpects. Nay they will not ſo much as yeeld, that the <hi>Lords day</hi> (for the <hi>particular Day,</hi> and for <hi>Frequency</hi> every week,) was certainly and infallibly ſo much as <hi>practiſed by all the Apoſtles.</hi> For divers of them <hi>quarrell</hi> and <hi>diſpute</hi> againſt all the places that mention any thing of it in the New Teſtament: Therefore ſay we again, the Apoſtles were far from <hi>determining,</hi> either the <hi>Frequency,</hi> or the particular day, or the <hi>Continuance</hi> ſpecially, (of which the greateſt controverſie is) yet this (or namely the <hi>Continuance</hi>) they ought to have <hi>determined</hi> as carefully as any thing, if it had been left to them. It being of greateſt <hi>Importance;</hi> as appeares (beſides all that we have formerly diſcourſed of the differance between two houres,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:112963:148"/>
or an houre, or halfe an houre (or leſſe) of a Day, and the whole <hi>Continuance</hi> of a Day for Religion:) even by our <hi>adverſaries</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſſe againſt us, for urging the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a whole Dayes <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;</hi> and our complaints of them for their <hi>ſcantying</hi> of God, and ſoules, by diſputing for leſſe. To avoyde then <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>prophaneſſe</hi> on the other, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (and Primitive Church) if they had had the <hi>authority</hi> of determining the <hi>Continuance,</hi> ought to have <hi>determined</hi> it, and would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it, if it had belonged to them; and would have made an authenticke cleare and <hi>ſufficient</hi> record of it, if they had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it. But they have done none of all this, as both our <hi>adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and we alſo jointly ſay. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we conclude (and we cannot imagine how they can poſſibly avoyde the dint of this argument, beſides all the other;) <hi>[That the Apoſtles and Primitive Church had no ſuch authority to determine this neceſſary and ſufficient chiefe ſolemne Time for Religion unto Chriſtians.]</hi> But that the <hi>Word</hi> of God, even in the Old Teſtament, that is, in the <hi>fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for <hi>one whole Day</hi> in ſeven, had done it for <hi>perpetuity,</hi> and they acknowledged it and obſerved it, and medled not with any <hi>alteration</hi> of it, or making any new determination. And that, as for the <hi>particular Day,</hi> they preached the <hi>old Day</hi> abrogated by Chriſt, and then as we have implyed heretofore (and ſhall again urge further hereafter) the firſt <hi>Day of the Weeke</hi> came, even by vertue of the <hi>determination</hi> of one in ſeven, in the roome of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; Beſides what may be argued for <hi>Chriſts juſtification</hi> of it, when we come to handle that queſtion againſt the <hi>Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batarians.</hi> And this being of leſſe <hi>importance</hi> then the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequency;</hi> God in His unſearcheable <hi>wiſdome</hi> thought fit only to afford ſome <hi>deſignations</hi> of its obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and His owning it as His in the New Teſtament, and not any <hi>peremptory command,</hi> like to that of the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> Of which alſo more hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XLIV. Arg. 11. Then it ſhould belong to every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</note>We proceed in our arguments. The next is this, <hi>[If the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of determining to Chriſtians the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion, belong to the Church; Then it belongs to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregationall Church to determine it unto its members; But it belongs not to every particular, congregationall Church, to determine it unto its members.</hi> Ergo, <hi>It belongs not to the Church
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:112963:148"/>
at all.</hi>] The <hi>Conſequence</hi> hath been partly made good already. But we muſt repeate thoſe things briefly, and bring them under one view together, and adde ſome other things to them for fuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. 1. The practiſe and obſervation of a <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Time for Religion</hi> immediately concernes every particular Church, (even every particular conſcience, as we have ſaid) for Gods <hi>honour</hi> among them, and the <hi>benefiting</hi> of all their ſoules. 2 The Time muſt be determined, and that as neceſſary and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that it may be ſo obſerved by that particular Church, and all its members. 3. It hath been already ſhewed the great <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties</hi> that there are, about the determination of this Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a <hi>Church</hi> Nationall or Vniverſall, and the <hi>Poſſibilies</hi> of their erring either in the point of <hi>neceſſity</hi> or of <hi>ſufficiency,</hi> through want of zeale, exceſſe of zeale, and want of prudence: In all theſe caſes, what can be ſaid, but that the <hi>authority</hi> muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to each particular <hi>congregationall Church</hi> for its members; that ſo God may have His <hi>honour</hi> among them, though he hath it not aright among others; and their <hi>ſouls</hi> may be benefited, and their <hi>conſciences</hi> not over-burthened, however it be in other Churches? 4. In caſe any particular <hi>Church</hi> be in a <hi>Paganiſh</hi> Country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and gathered by meanes of ſome <hi>captive Chriſtian,</hi> or the like; who yet is able to ſhew no authenticke proofe of any <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of the univerſall Church in this point, nor of any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Church, which this particular Church ſhould be bound to, by vertue of their authority over it; It is of <hi>neceſſity</hi> that that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church determine the Time for it ſelfe and its members. 5. To this Day, as we toucht before, the <hi>univerſall Church</hi> hath not (nor ſcarce any <hi>Nationall</hi> Church, of late) made a cleare <hi>determination,</hi> (or <hi>declaration)</hi> of the <hi>Continuance,</hi> of the Day which is by practiſe every where weekely obſerved. How much, we ſay, of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> is to be <hi>kept holy and ſtrictly for God and the ſoule?</hi> Yet this is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be determined. Therefore the <hi>authority</hi> to determine it muſt needs be devolved to every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church,</hi> through the defect of the univerſall Churches <hi>determination</hi> of it, and ſo of Nationall, and Provinciall, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan, or Claſſicall Churches. As alſo (as was argued formerly) in particular Churches <hi>default</hi> in like ſort; to <hi>particular Perſons</hi> for themſelves, and their owne ſoules and conſciences ſingle.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:112963:149"/>
6. Finally, the <hi>Scripture,</hi> upon our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> ſuppoſitions, is undeniably (we thinke) for this: And ſo is the <hi>practiſe</hi> of the Chriſtian Church. 1. The firſt certaine intimation we have in Scripture of the <hi>new Day</hi> obſerved by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> (though this alſo, ſome quarrell with, and queſtion) is <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. which was in a <hi>particular Church,</hi> at <hi>Troas;</hi> and our <hi>Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> will not allow us to inferre from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> preſence, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it with them, that he inſtituted it there; and much leſſe among all Churches. It was then (as they contend) the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>inſtitution</hi> of that particular Church of <hi>Troas;</hi> and ſo the determination of the <hi>particular Day</hi> and <hi>Frequency</hi> (whatever was, or was not, of the <hi>Continuance</hi>) belonged to particular Churches. 2. Our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> refuſe alſo the intimation of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. (notwithſtanding the mention of an <hi>Ordination,</hi> at leaſt, about the <hi>Collection</hi>) that either to <hi>Corinth,</hi> or to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> the Apoſtle did inſtitute or determine the <hi>firſt Day</hi> of the weeke to Religion. Yet it was <hi>obſerved</hi> then (as they doe not deny in their <hi>good moods,</hi> though they can find in their hearts to diſpute againſt that place alſo; Therefore the <hi>inſtitution</hi> and determination was made by thoſe particular Churches, for the Day, and the Frequency at leaſt. 3. The <hi>practiſe</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church will ſay the ſame too. For 300 yeeres after Chriſt, there was not (neither could there be till there was a Chriſtian Emperour) any <hi>generall Councell.</hi> So that the univerſall Church determined it not, neither could it. Nor doe we read any <hi>Nationall</hi> or Provinciall Councell that ſeemes to determine it, till that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which was neer 300 yeeres after Chriſts <hi>reſurrection;</hi> Whereas the <hi>Lords day</hi> was practiſed and obſerved by that name, and the name of the firſt Day of the weeke, in every age from the Apoſtles Times, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. It muſt be then inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and <hi>determined</hi> by ſome particular Churches, and imitated by others, and ſo came to be <hi>univerſally</hi> practiſed: Unleſſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inſtituted and determined it for all, (which our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> admit not, and we have diſproved in their ſenſe,) or that God and Chriſt <hi>ordained</hi> it (whether immediately or mediately by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> it matters not greatly) and ſo certainly it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">XLV. Which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by many reaſons.</note>For now to prove our Antecedent, <hi>[That it belongs: not to every particular congregationall Church to make this determination.]</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:112963:149"/>
1. It is not <hi>credible</hi> that all particular Churches, if the power were in themſelves, would determine the ſame <hi>Continuance,</hi> nor the ſame <hi>Frequency,</hi> nor ſo much as the ſame <hi>particular Day.</hi> For to ſpeake of the firſt, doe not our <hi>diſputers</hi> now argue one while for <hi>Thurſday</hi> to be as fit a Day, in <hi>memory</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Aſcention,</hi> as the Lords day in memory of His <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> Another while for <hi>Friday,</hi> in memory of His death? How would this then be, if they, or ſuch as they, had the <hi>authority</hi> in their owne hand, (much, if not altogether) being the Miniſters, and ſo at leaſt the chiefe in authority in the particular Congregations? ſhould we not be likely in a great City, as <hi>London,</hi> but ſpecially in a <hi>Nation,</hi> or Kingdome, to have <hi>all the Dayes of the Weeke</hi> determined by one or other <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church,</hi> namely one by one, and another by another, and ſo others by others? Againe, in ſuch <hi>diverſities</hi> of tempers, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of <hi>zeale,</hi> or <hi>worldlineſſe;</hi> wanting a <hi>ſteady Rule</hi> (as we ſhall ſee) and ſo a ground of <hi>wiſedome,</hi> would there not be greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>variety</hi> about the <hi>Frequency</hi> and <hi>Continuance?</hi> 2. In all Churches, that were neere one another, <hi>diverſities</hi> of Dayes would breed great diſturbance of one another, and the members of each from others, and <hi>hindrance</hi> alſo to trafficke, and journies, and all buſineſſe; and in a word, introduce nothing but diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Which yet would be more increaſed, by a <hi>diverſity</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Frequency</hi> and <hi>Continuance,</hi> whereby thoſe that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and were tied to more and oftener, would be reproacht by others as <hi>over-preciſe,</hi> and would be apt to <hi>grumble</hi> at their owne bondage; And they that obſerved and were tied to leſſe and ſeldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, would be <hi>cenſured</hi> as prophane and careleſſe of Religion; and perhaps would be in doubt of the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of their Churches determination; and ſo be apt to make a <hi>ſchiſme</hi> in it, or from it. 3. If it were reſolved once, that this authority did certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to every <hi>particular Church,</hi> it would hardly be agreed among them unto whom it did belong. Whether to the <hi>Miniſter</hi> (or <hi>Miniſters</hi>) alone, as ſome would thinke? Or to them and the <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> together, as others would ſay? Or to the <hi>whole people</hi> with them, that is, all the men growne, as others would maintaine? Or even taking in <hi>women</hi> alſo, as the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> doe, in matters of Church-government? And in this, the <hi>difficulty</hi> would be the greater; becauſe (as we have urged before) the thing
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:112963:150"/>
concernes the <hi>conſciences</hi> of every one exceedingly in a point of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary practiſe for Gods <hi>Honour,</hi> and their ſoules good; and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary freedome for their ſoules <hi>benefit,</hi> and neceſſary <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for their conſciences. We ſay, this concernes <hi>people</hi> as well as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Elders, and women as well as men; and therefore all muſt have ſome ſhare in the determination: So farre, as if it be not at all <hi>determined</hi> in any reſpect (as even for <hi>Continuance</hi>) they muſt determine it for themſelves; And 2.

But we conceive, all will be much more ſtrengthened, which we have argued, by the <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of another generall <hi>Argument,</hi> againſt any mans, or number of mens determinations of it, even the Churches, whether in times of the old <hi>Patriarks</hi> before <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Chriſtian Church of the New Teſtament; and that is in <hi>point of Wiſdome:</hi> As having no <hi>Rule,</hi> whereby poſſibly to guide themſelves ſteadily in the making of this <hi>determination</hi> of the <hi>chiefe Time neceſſary and ſufficient.</hi> For, whatſoever we take into conſideration, that may ſeem to make towards a <hi>Rule;</hi> will and doth render it more <hi>perplexe;</hi> Either calling for <hi>ſo much,</hi> as men will never be willing to grant <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;</hi> or leaving them altogether <hi>uncertaine,</hi> whether that they would pitch upon, were <hi>ſufficient,</hi> both in <hi>reference</hi> to the <hi>whole proportion of the chiefe Time;</hi> as alſo the <hi>diſtribution</hi> of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, whatever it be, between the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequencie,</hi> ſave only in caſe they would pitch upon a <hi>whole Dayes</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to which <hi>Nature</hi> inclines very much, as we have intimated before, and muſt againe further urge.) Thus we reaſon:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[If there be in Men no ſufficiencie of wiſdome to make this Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

of the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe ſolemne Time for Religion to themſelves and others; Then this Determination belongs not to Men. But there is in Men no ſufficiencie of wiſdome to make this Determination.</hi> Ergo, <hi>It belongs not to Men.]</hi> The <hi>Conſequence</hi> needs no great labour to prove it. God is too <hi>wiſe,</hi> too jealous of His own <hi>Honour,</hi> too full of <hi>love</hi> to His peoples ſoules, to leave ſuch a matter as this is ſo <hi>important</hi> to Religion, to be determined by ſuch as have not a ſufficiencie of <hi>wiſedome</hi> for it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">XLVII.

For our <hi>Antecedent</hi> in this, and in the <hi>whole,</hi> will be abundantly cleared by a ſerious conſidering whatſoever may be pretended, either generally or particularly, in whole or in part, to be a <hi>rule</hi> in theſe caſes.

Again, for particular <hi>rules,</hi> totall or partiall, There are none proper to this Queſtion, but one of theſe four Conſiderations. 1. The <hi>Nature of the Object of Worſhip, and the primary end of all Religious Time</hi> determined or obſerved; Namely <hi>God,</hi> whoſe nature is unqueſtionably infinite. 2. The <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>prime Subject</hi> of Worſhip, and the ſecondary end of all <hi>Religious Time</hi> determined or obſerved; namely, the <hi>Soule</hi> of Man, which in the duration of it is ordained to be <hi>infinite,</hi> and in the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of it toward the proviſion for Eternity, is next to Infinite. 3. The <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> in which, that is, in the <hi>variety</hi> of ſome or other of them, all <hi>Religious Time</hi> determined is to be imployed: whoſe <hi>nature</hi> will appeare to be generally (except in one caſe or two) <hi>indefinite.</hi> 4. The <hi>nature of the ſecondary Subject,</hi> and uſuall and certaine Impediment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, (that it cannot have all Time allotted to it) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>body,</hi> and bodily and worldly buſineſſes; which allow not, we ſay, <hi>all Time</hi> to be devoted to Religion and Solemn Worſhip: but call for a <hi>ſhare</hi> of Time from every man, both for <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Frequencie,</hi> all his life long. The <hi>nature</hi> of which buſineſſes will appeare to be, 1. Sutable to corrupted Nature. 2. Exceeding various, numerous, and uncertaine; and capable alſo of taking up all the Time of life, if they might be ſuffered. 3. At the beſt but ſecondary and inferior buſineſſes. And theſe foure <hi>Conſiderations</hi> were all the <hi>rules,</hi> that <hi>Adam,</hi> or any of the old <hi>Patriarks</hi> could have to look to, toward the making of this <hi>Determination of the neceſſary and ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion;</hi> if it had been (as is ſuppoſed by our <hi>Diſputers</hi>) left to them to make for themſelves and others. And they are all alſo that the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> can well pretend to, ſuppoſing the <hi>Determination</hi> left to them. Only to gratifie our <hi>Diſputers,</hi> who ſeem often to fancy, as though the <hi>Proportion</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> obſerved, (or rather, we ſay, which <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to them) of <hi>one Day in ſeven,</hi> may ſerve for ſome kind of <hi>rule</hi> to eſtimate this <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſufficient Time</hi> by; Though by no means they will yield that <hi>particular proportion</hi> (and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution) to be neceſſary and ſufficient now; For that were to yield, in effect, the <hi>whole Cauſe:</hi> We will (we ſay, to gratifie them) take this alſo into conſideration. And ſo with the beſt skill we have,

examine and ſet before our <hi>Readers</hi> all theſe five, ſeverally and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, according both to the Law and Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall expreſſions of <hi>Scripture:</hi> And ſee what will come of it; And whether, after all, men will not fall ſhort of a <hi>ſufficient Rule</hi> to make this Determination <hi>wiſely</hi> by, if it were left to them.</p>

And this, we ſay, both <hi>Scripture</hi> chiefly, and <hi>Nature</hi> alſo, (at leaſt not reaſonably contradicting) proclaime to be infinite in <hi>duration,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to an <hi>Eternity</hi> of happineſſe, or miſery: and its <hi>neceſſities</hi> to ſecure this happineſſe, and avoid this miſery, (conſidering what <hi>corruption</hi> it hath) are next to <hi>infinite.</hi> Which way then can that which is infinite (or next to infinite) afford a <hi>direction</hi> to judge any <hi>proportion</hi> definite to be ſufficient for it?

And if the inevitable <hi>neceſſities</hi> of Nature for eating, drinking, and ſleeping, &amp;c. be pleaded: yet we doubt not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Soule</hi> would not, or ſhould not, <hi>grudge</hi> even at theſe, as endangering to <hi>hinder</hi> that which is of more <hi>importance</hi> than meat, or drinke, or ſleepe, or even than the bodily <hi>life</hi> and ſubſiſtence it ſelfe. Not that we imagine or dreame, that God hath not allowed (even by the light of Nature, and much more by Scripture) <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Times</hi> for all theſe bodily neceſſities. But yet we know, that both <hi>God</hi> ſometimes commands to <hi>faſt,</hi> and forbeare all meat and drinke for a ſpace, and ſo to watch even whole nights, for the <hi>good</hi> of Soules, our own ſpecially, but alſo even of others: As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that when a Soule growes <hi>extraordinarily ſollicitous</hi> of its own ſalvation, (and ſometimes even of others) It cannot afford to <hi>eat or drinke,</hi> it cannot <hi>ſleep,</hi> ready ſometimes even to ſtarve it ſelfe, or kill it ſelfe with <hi>over-watching;</hi> but that it is forced up doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe

even by Gods command, urged upon them by friends, and the <hi>feare</hi> of prejudicing their very ſalvation, if they ſhould be cauſes of their own death. And moreover, it is uſuall with many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to think much and repine at all the Time, wherein they are not <hi>ſpiritually imployed</hi> for their ſoules; even though they cannot deny, but God hath not only allowed, but even commanded them to imploy houres, and dayes, many and many, upon worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: which <hi>command</hi> and <hi>allowance</hi> of His, is the only thing that ſatisfies them; or elſe they could never, ſo far forth as they <hi>think</hi> of their ſoules, be willing to allow <hi>any Time</hi> at all to any other thing. And therefore there is no manner of <hi>help</hi> from hence for any ſhare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Time, between the ſoul, and worldly occaſions.

That there are yet manifold things in <hi>Religion,</hi> which are greatly <hi>neceſſary</hi> for it to know, what ever knowledge it hath already attained to; and theſe call for a great deale of Time to learne them; 2. And how <hi>forgetfull</hi> they are from Time to Time of the things they have learned; and that calls alſo for much Time to preſerve them in memory, and recover any they have loſt; 3. Withall the <hi>faintneſſe</hi> of their godly affection; 4. And the ſtrength of their <hi>corruptions;</hi> which require ſtill much and often Time to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the one, and combate, and mortifie the other; 5. And finally, their being <hi>aſſaulted</hi> daily and hourely with <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> and afflictions, and their peace and comfort further waſted by ſins and corruptions; which makes them ſtand in need of Time: Yet more, to regaine that peace and comfort when it is gone or waſted; and to enjoy ſpirituall <hi>refreſhings</hi> in the boſome of Gods love. All this together cannot but make a ſoul think no <hi>meaſure</hi> of <hi>Time, leſſe then all,</hi> neceſſary and ſufficient, for attendance upon Him, whom it is bound to love with its whole ſelf, mind, heart, ſtrength: and ſo to <hi>worke</hi> upon it ſelf, that it may love Him, and be ſure of His love: And when it hath once attained to this <hi>love of Him</hi> above all other things, and to an <hi>aſſurance</hi> of His love to it, it cannot but ſtill think, <hi>all Time</hi> is little enough, and too little, to ſerve Him in <hi>thankfulneſſe</hi> for His love: and to <hi>enjoy</hi> His love, and its own happineſſe in <hi>attendance</hi> upon Him, and converſe with Him.

And the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> alſo is ſoon diſpatcht, by each particular Communicant. But then it (as well as any of the <hi>other duties</hi> of Prayer, Preaching, Reading the Word, Praiſes, Singing, Meditations, Conferences, Catechiſings,) is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a <hi>Daily Frequency.</hi> And all thoſe may be <hi>reiterated</hi> oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, even every <hi>new minute,</hi> after an interruption; and that every Day of ones life.

On the other ſide, they may any of them be ſuddenly diſpatched. If a man did preach but halfe a quarter of an houre, or a minute (as <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Act.</hi> 10. exceeded not a <hi>minute,</hi> or very little, when the <hi>fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt on all them that heard the Word,</hi> made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, proclaiming withall a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of acceptation and bleſſing, for that Time, of his ſpeaking and their hearing;) it might be a <hi>true ſervice</hi> of God, acceptable to Him, and profitable to ſouls: And ſo the <hi>reading</hi> of a verſe, or ſentence of the Scripture; Or the ſinging of a verſe or line: Or the praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as long only, as the Publicans <hi>[God be mercifull to me a ſinner.]</hi> And ſo a word or

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:112963:154"/>
too <hi>largely,</hi> and too <hi>ſlender</hi> pittances left for God and the ſoul: As is more then apparant in many, who, though their conſciences cannot deny the <hi>fourth Commandement</hi> to concerne them and theirs, even for a <hi>whole Day in a weeke;</hi> yet doe not, nor cannot <hi>afford</hi> God and their ſoules <hi>halfe</hi> the Day, becauſe their minds are ſo ſet upon pampering their <hi>bellies,</hi> and giving way to their <hi>lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> by lying longer in bed that morning then all the weeke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and going ſooner to bed that night then any other, beſides <hi>ſleeping,</hi> ſometimes in the very Day time (not to ſay, in the very <hi>Church,</hi> and at the ſolemne ſervice of God;) alſo finding ſundry <hi>pretended neceſſities,</hi> of this, or that worldly buſineſſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs: And much more is this evident in thoſe, who have learned the <hi>confidence</hi> to deny the Commandement for <hi>one whole Day of ſeven,</hi> and only pretend to acknowledge (with our <hi>diſputers</hi>) a ſufficient Time that God muſt have. But there is ſo much <hi>correſpondency</hi> and ſutableneſſe betweene their <hi>bodily</hi> or worldly occaſions, and their <hi>carnall corruptions,</hi> that they make a ſhift to <hi>ſhuffle</hi> God and their ſoules off with a very <hi>leane and thinne allowance of Time,</hi> ſufficient indeed for nothing, but to render them the more <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> that making ſhew of acknowledging a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Time</hi> to be neceſſary to <hi>Religion,</hi> they allot ſuch a <hi>miſerable inſufficient parcell to it.</hi> And there is no reaſon to expect it will be any better ordered, while mens corrupted nature hath no better counſellours, then the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>worldly occaſions,</hi> (under the name of <hi>neceſſities</hi>) to helpe to divide and diſtribute the proportions of His <hi>Time</hi> for Religion. 2. This the rather, becauſe the buſineſſes of the <hi>body,</hi> and of the world towards the bodily life, are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and various, and uncertaine, running round throughout the whole yeere (as is ſaid of a husband-mans worke, that it is never done; and ſo it is with all worldly buſineſſes in one regard or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and capable alſo of ingroſſing the <hi>whole</hi> of every day; which is moſt apparant in ſervants, and thoſe that ſpend their Times chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the pleaſures of other men: So that there is no poſſibility of concluding before hand, with reſpect to worldly buſineſſes, <hi>[I may certainly ſpare for Religion ſo many Dayes of a yeere, or of a moneth or weeke, or ſo many houres of a weeke, or Day; becauſe I ſhall have nothing to doe about worldly affaires, but may be free to attend on God.]</hi> We ſay, this can never be ſaid in reference to

all mankind, (of whom our diſpute now is) and ſo we ſhould have moſt <hi>wild determinations,</hi> if men take their aimes, only, or chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the conſiderations of <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>worldly</hi> buſineſſes, in the proportioning a <hi>neceſſary and ſufficient chiefe Time</hi> for God and the ſoule. 3. For alſo, at the beſt, the bodily and worldly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are but ſecondary and inferiour matters, farre beneath in <hi>worth,</hi> not only the <hi>Honour</hi> of God but the <hi>good</hi> of ſoules. And it cannot be fit, or agreable to wiſdome, that inferiour matters ſhould give a Rule to ſuperiour; or be a meaſure to them, that is, for the <hi>maine</hi> and <hi>chiefe part</hi> of our Time. It is true indeed, That Gods gracious <hi>indulgence</hi> to mans bodily life, and outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, doth allow <hi>interruptions</hi> in ſome reſerved caſes from His ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemneſt ſervices, and ſo from His owne moſt <hi>ſolemne determined Times,</hi> as we have often ſaid.

Much leſſe then, without His <hi>indulgence,</hi> may any conſcience conclude, and determine, <hi>[That ſuch bodily and worldly buſineſſe as fals within the compaſſe of every mans calling, may be allowed to be the divider, and the diſtributer of the chiefe Time of all men, and ſo God and the ſoules of men have no other allowance for the chiefe Time to Religion, then what thoſe worldly conſiderations ſhall allot.]</hi> This thought about Gods <hi>indulgence</hi> is a moſt weighty and moſt neceſſary conſideration in this diſpute.

We ſhall therefore anon make a diſtinct argument of it, that we may be ſure, they, and all <hi>Readers</hi> that will take the paines to view thoſe diſcourſes, ſhall not be able to miſſe it, or paſſe it ſleightly over: But we muſt firſt make up this Argument, and another in the meane Time. We ſay then, that by all this diſcourſe, <hi>of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, the Nature of the Soule, the Nature of the Duties of Worſhip, the Nature of the Body, and worldly occaſions:</hi> Take any of them ſingle and apart, or joyne any of them or all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the conſultation; and we are as farre as can be from any <hi>gueſſe</hi> how to proportion the <hi>Time,</hi> betweene Religion and other matters; except that we ought undoubtedly to ſay; (if we have nothing but theſe to direct us) <hi>[That to Gods honour, and the ſouls benefit, the farre greater proportion of Time is neceſſary, and that it
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:112963:155"/>
cannot be ſufficient to let the world poſſeſſe the largeſt ſhare.]</hi> And if this be true; (as we cannot ſee how it can poſſibly be denyed, and we ſhall yet further confirme it in a following argument;) our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> have made a goodly purchſſe, by diſputing the <hi>abrogation of the fourth Commandement for one Day in ſeven:</hi> In as much as in ſtead of their pretended <hi>Chriſtian liberty</hi> not to be tyed to ſuch a proportion; all other rules call for twiſe, thriſe, as much; and rather for <hi>ſix Dayes of ſeven,</hi> and leave but <hi>one</hi> for worldly buſineſſes. And if they ſhall object,<note place="margin">Excep</note> that mens <hi>bodily lives</hi> could not be preſerved with ſo little a proportion for worldly buſineſſes and trades. We Anſwer (ſet aſide the <hi>Wiſdome</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and His allowance of ſix Dayes Worke, in the fourth Commandement) it is not poſſible for any man living, or any number of men, to aſſigne certainly, how much <hi>Time</hi> is to be ſpent in <hi>worldly buſineſſes</hi> for the preſervation of mankind in a bodily life. If there were that ſimplicity of Diet, of Apparell, of Buildings &amp; all other things, that there was in the firſt Ages of the world, and is yet in ſome Countries (though our <hi>pride</hi> and curioſity call them <hi>Barbarous</hi> for it,) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great deale <hi>leſſe Time</hi> would ſerve then now doth, for worldly matters. And though, as the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the world now is, we are far from blaming ſuch <hi>Trades</hi> and <hi>Manufacturers,</hi> or the uſing of them, as ſinnes, becauſe ſpecially we beleeve <hi>God</hi> to have allowed ſix Dayes in a Week, mainly for worldly buſineſſe according to the fourth Commandement: Yet we ſay ſtill, that if this <hi>allowance</hi> were not, we ſee not any warrant, to imploy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſo much in theſe <hi>buſineſſes</hi> (which, as we ſaid, have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of old, and are ſpared in other places at this Day,) to ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious prejudice and undervaluing of <hi>God</hi> and His <hi>honour,</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> of ſoules. And ſo ſtill we are altogether at a <hi>leſſe</hi> for a <hi>rule of wiſdome,</hi> how to determine, our <hi>neceſſary and ſufficient chiefe Solemne Time for Religion.</hi> And therefore this <hi>determination</hi> could not be, nor was ever left to man, to <hi>Adam,</hi> or the Partriarkes before <hi>Moſes</hi> (Much loſſe to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and Heathen for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs,) nor yet to the <hi>Church</hi> of the New Teſtament;<note place="margin">LII. 5. Nor the old proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one Day in ſeven in the fou th Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> But remained ever in <hi>Gods</hi> hand, which is the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not forget our fifth <hi>Conſideration</hi> mentioned in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church: That our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> in their <hi>beſt moodes,</hi> when they ſay, <hi>The Church muſt not offend in exceſſe

or defect; not render the yoke of Chriſtians too heavy by appointing too much, nor ſlight, or ſeeme to ſlight the ſervice of God, and render it contemptible by appointing too little;</hi> They ſeeme to fancy, that the <hi>proportion of one Day of ſeven.</hi> (though by no meanes <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be perpetuated) may be a convenient <hi>direction,</hi> that thereabouts it ſhould be among <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and accordingly in the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> ever <hi>one Day</hi> in a week hath been obſerved, which with the addition of <hi>Holy dayes</hi> more rarely appointed, they count a <hi>ſufficient Time for Religion,</hi> equall, if not ſuperiour to the <hi>Time</hi> that God had from the <hi>Jewes</hi> under the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Now to this, we have divers things to ſay, though we will not offer to follow their extravagancies in and out (ſtep by ſtep) in this diſpute, but onely ſhew ſomewhat the <hi>inſufficiency</hi> and abſurdity of this pretence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">LIII. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved abſurd.</note>We ſay then 1. That for other <hi>Holy dayes,</hi> beſides the weekely <hi>Solemne day,</hi> they come not properly into this diſpute, about the <hi>ordinary chiefe Time for Religion.</hi> They are 1. <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Dayes, of which kind the <hi>Jewes</hi> alſo had ſome of Gods appointing, and ſome of their own, more then many <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches have, though not ſo many as ſome others. Alſo 2. <hi>Theſe</hi> are taken up without any ſuch <hi>rule,</hi> as may either urge the conſcience to judge them <hi>neceſſary;</hi> or conclude them together to be <hi>ſufficient.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 3. Alſo herein the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches greatly differ, which as we have argued before, muſt not be in the proportions of the <hi>chiefe ſolemne Time</hi> neceſſary and ſufficient for all Chriſtians. Likewiſe 4. No <hi>Church</hi> Reformed, that hath retained <hi>Holy dayes,</hi> hath ſpoken fully and clearely about the <hi>Continuance</hi> of them, and how <hi>neceſſarily</hi> they are to be obſerved to <hi>Religion,</hi> and imployed wholly in Religious duties or not. And ſo they come not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into this diſpute about the <hi>neceſſary chiefe Time</hi> for Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Leaving theſe out, and conſidering the <hi>weekely</hi> ſolemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, it was of old determined to the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: <hi>One whole Day of ſeven.</hi> Both which (as well as the particular ſeventh Day, the <hi>Saturday Sabbath,</hi> which they pin to the Commandement: But we ſhal ſhew their errour in it hereafter,) our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> make to be now abrogated by Chriſt, that is, both the <hi>number,</hi> one Day of ſeven, and the <hi>Continuance,</hi> one whole Day.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:112963:156"/>
the ſuppoſition of <hi>Gods</hi> making theſe void, they can finde out a <hi>rule</hi> for the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church to make a determination of the <hi>chiefe Time</hi> for Religion, for <hi>Frequency</hi> and <hi>Continuance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt we muſt diſcourſe of the <hi>Frequency,</hi>

Now the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of this <hi>number</hi> of one Day in ſeven, we ſay is by Gods <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of the fourth Commandement ſtill in force. They ſay, only by the Churches <hi>Authority,</hi> freely taking it up again, after it was made void. But againſt this we argue, That the <hi>Church</hi> having in their opinion, <hi>authority</hi> to chuſe another <hi>number,</hi> more Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>one of</hi> 6. or 5. or more rare (though ſometimes they deny this,) as <hi>one of</hi> 8. or 10. It cannot by any juſt reaſon be juſtified or excuſed in determining again <hi>one Day</hi> of ſeven, nor can any rule of <hi>wiſedome</hi> plead for the obſerving of that number, if caſt by, by God. But rather all things are againſt it, proclaiming, that that <hi>number</hi> of all other was the moſt unfit to be taken up again by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, when as God had rejected it, upon ſo great an occaſion as the <hi>Death of Chriſt, His Son, and our Saviour.</hi> And for this we have divers particular reaſons.</p>

and fallacious aſſertion, if underſtood generally, as we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and fully ſhew in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> where we ſhall take that Poſition to task, and anſwer what they bring to prove it: Mean time, we ſay in a word, 1. that we having already in the former <hi>chap.</hi> proved a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the determination of a <hi>chiefe Time neceſſary to Religion for all men;</hi> they apparantly beg the queſtion, if they only anſwer, that there is now <hi>no Times neceſſary to Religion:</hi> And ſo in ſtead of anſwering our Argument, which proceeds on that ſuppoſition, they wholly pervert the ſtate of the queſtion now between us. 2.

                  <note place="margin">LXIV. A Queſtion anſwered.</note>If any now ask, What Commandement we mean all this while, within whoſe <hi>generall meaning</hi> this is which we have ſpoken of? We anſwer, 1. If we could not aſſigne directly and certainly the particular Commandement; yet would the thing, upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going grounds, be no leſſe certaine; There being divers other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are undoubtedly within the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> about which Divines differ, in what Commandement they are; as appeares by comparing the Expoſitions of the Commandements in almoſt any two Authors. 2. Yet we ſay, that for our parts, we ſuppoſe, <hi>[That this is properly belonging to the fourth Commandement, and is indeed the whole and entire generall meaning thereof.]</hi> The words proclaime, That the object of the Commandement is <hi>Time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Religion, and Gods honour.</hi> And therefore we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the generall meaning and ſcope of it is as we have expreſt, [That <hi>thoſe Times, and thoſe only, ſhould be obſerved as neceſſarie to Religion, which God himſelfe appoints.</hi>] And ſo, though we prove (as we doubt not but we ſhall in the next Part) [That <hi>the words of the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>

                  </hi>] Yet the <hi>particular Day</hi> (both of old the ſeventh in order from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and now the firſt of the ſeven) come within the compaſſe of the fourth Commandement, within this <hi>generall meaning,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:112963:162"/>
they were appointed by God, though elſewhere, and not in the <hi>formall</hi> words of the Commandement. And ſo alſo the other Jewiſh <hi>Feſtivals</hi> appointed by God, ſhall properly belong to the ſame fourth Commandement, falling under the <hi>generall mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> mentioned. And indeed they are uſually by Divines reduced thither; Who yet can no wayes defend their aſſigning them to that (predicament or) place, if this be not aſſigned to be the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meaning</hi> of the fourth Commandement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet if any will not admit this, then we ſay, we know not how they will be able to deny, but that this is, <hi>[Though not the whole, yet a part of the generall meaning of the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:]</hi> Which under the prohibition of <hi>Worſhipping God by an Image,</hi> and promiſe of a bleſſing to them that keepe His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, (namely that Worſhip Him with that Worſhip, that He hath commanded) carries this generall meaning certainly, <hi>[That God ſhould be Worſhipped with thoſe things, and actions, and thoſe only, which Himſelfe hath appointed.]</hi> And ſo, as under this, all the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Worſhip of Old, <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and other Rites and Lawes belonging to Gods Worſhip; and our two Sacraments now are compriſed; (and ſo the prohibition of all ſuperſtition and will-worſhip invented by men) by the uſuall vote of Divines, and cannot indeed come properly under any other. So, the obſervation of any <hi>Times as neceſſary to Religion, and Gods Worſhip,</hi> and of thoſe Times and thoſe only, as ſo neceſſary which God Himſelfe appoints, muſt needs fall under the ſame <hi>Generall meaning</hi> of the ſecond Commandement, if it belong not peculiarly to the fourth, as was ſaid before. And perhaps how ever, if an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act inquiry be made into the <hi>Latitudes</hi> of the Commandements of the firſt Table, they will all be found in an <hi>ſubordination,</hi> the latter more particular then the former, and partly at leaſt included in it. Undoubtedly the firſt, concludes with in it the three latter, even all the ſecond Table alſo; and we thinke the ſecond contains ſome part of the third, and fourth alſo; and againe that the third, doth containe part of the fourth; namely the manner of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the holy Time, that it be not in vaine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we leave this <hi>Notion</hi> to the juditious Readers conſideration, and maintaine our Argument ſufficiently without it, whether the generall Law about Time we are now ſcanning, be in the fourth, or part of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:112963:163"/>
ſecond, or even belong to the firſt, (as ſo much as is <hi>Morall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall difinitely,</hi> concerning Time for Religion, we have formerly aſſerted to be within the firſt Commandement) ſtill as long as it is within the <hi>Decalogue</hi> our cauſe is ſafe.

                  <hi>[If all Time is Gods, and none mens owne for worldly buſineſſe but by Gods indulgence, Then the determination of the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe ſolemne Time for Religion, cannot belong to men but it is Gods owne peculiar: But all Time is Gods, and none mens owne for worldly buſineſſe; but by Gods indulgence.</hi> Ergo, <hi>The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe ſolemne Time for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, cannot belong to men but is Gods peculiar.]</hi> The <hi>Antecedent</hi> cannot reaſonably be denied by any conſcience that acknowledges God, the <hi>Creatour</hi> of all men, and all Time, and ſo the undoubted, and abſolute <hi>Soveraigne and Lord</hi> of all; and that conſiders that, even the moſt <hi>neceſſary worldly Times,</hi> as for ſleeping, eating, and the like, are no otherwiſe, Ours but by His <hi>indulgence,</hi> granted indeed in <hi>Nature</hi> ordinarily, and ſo manifeſted ſufficiently by the Light of Nature. Yet can it not be denied, but even theſe <hi>Times</hi> are ſtill ſubject to His pleaſure which may make exceptions againſt them, as indeed He ſundry times doth: enjoyning men (as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly noted) by His providence (and by generall Rules of His Word) to watch whole <hi>Nights</hi> and <hi>Dayes;</hi> and to <hi>Faſt</hi> likewiſe, in Religious references to Him, and their owne, and others ſoules, to performe <hi>ſolemne</hi> and <hi>extraordinary Duties</hi> of piety and charity; and ſometimes even with reſpect to the bodily lives and comforts of themſelves or others. Moreover, it cannot againe be denied, but if it pleaſed Him, He might command men altother to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare</hi> their <hi>meat,</hi> and waite upon Him for a <hi>miraculous preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:112963:163"/>
(like that of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and our bleſſed Saviour, for whole forty Dayes, and forty Nights together, and as it ſhall be with us all eternally in Heaven;) and even appoint men to die, for very want of meat or ſleepe; rather then intermit, or interrupt their <hi>ſolemne attendances</hi> upon Him. So that it is every way cleare <hi>[That no Time at all is ours for any worldly buſineſſe, but by Gods indulgence,]</hi> which is our <hi>Antecedent</hi> of the preſent argument.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Conſequence,</hi> that thence it followes,<note place="margin">LXVI. Confirmed by 4 reaſons.</note> 
                  <hi>[That the determination of the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe ſolemne Time for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is Gods owne peculiar, and belongs not to men.]</hi> This, we ſuppoſe, will be manifeſt, by conſidering, 1.

(We ſay, <hi>mainly,</hi> becauſe ſtill, according to what hath been before diſcourſed, God in the very Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> calls for ſome Times every Day, even out of the Work-dayes; beſides all <hi>extraordinary Times</hi> for Religion; but the determination of the <hi>chiefe Time</hi> for Religion being ſet, the reſidue is mainly for <hi>worldly buſineſſes,</hi> even allotted to them by that very determination of ſuch Time, as <hi>ſufficient</hi> ordinarily for the chiefe Time to Religion.) 2. Therefore to aſcribe to men the determination of this <hi>chiefe ſufficient Time to Religion,</hi> is to aſcribe to them the allotment of their <hi>owne Time</hi> for worldly buſineſſes: As contrarily to aſcribe to God the allotment of mens Times for their worldly buſineſſes, is to aſcribe to Him, the <hi>determination</hi> of this <hi>ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion.</hi> 3. Now that it is not in men, but in God (not only <hi>originally,</hi> which the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> cannot deny, though perhaps they thinke not enough of it, nor ſpeake enough of it; but alſo <hi>Practically</hi>) to allot to men the main Time for their worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, (whether they be Inferiours, or Superiours, Pagans or Chriſtians, worldly or godly) may be made good by foure <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,</hi> as we conceive them to be, drawne from the <hi>Light</hi> both of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Scripture.</hi> Although we cannot here forbeare to ſay, (and referre to the Readers to <hi>judge</hi> what cauſe we have for it) <hi>[That our diſputers in this whole controverſie about religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Time, ſeeme abſolutely to be of the mind; that however all Time be originally Gods, and He may ſtill challenge what He pleaſes by an expreſſe Law; Yet in practiſe, He hath rather given over Time

Here then we appeale again to the conſciences of all that will conſider God, and mens ſoules in one ballance, and mens worldly buſineſſes in another: How hath the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> dared to take <hi>ſix Dayes ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to themſelves, and leave God but <hi>one</hi> of ſeven? how hath it da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of Time, <hi>leſſe then all,</hi> to be <hi>ſufficient for mens ſoules.]</hi> And this we are put in mind of by the very firſt mention of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining a particular Time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. under the terme of <hi>Bleſſing:</hi> which alſo the Commandement emphatically repeates, and <hi>Eſay</hi> particularly comments upon, as we ſhall ſee. We ſay, whatſoever <hi>Time</hi> is taken out of the whole, and allotted by <hi>Indulgence</hi> to worldly buſineſſe, doth not (nor cannot) leave the reſidue, how great ſoever the proportion be, <hi>ſufficient for mens ſoules,</hi> but by vertue of <hi>ſpeciall bleſſing</hi> upon that proportion of <hi>Time</hi> which is determined for ſoules, be it more or leſſe. And this <hi>Bleſſing</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming only from God, the determined <hi>proportion</hi> muſt be alſo from Him for Religion, which of it ſelfe gives aſſurance of an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>bleſſing</hi> according to the intendment of that Time, even though there ſhould be no diſtinct mention of a <hi>Bleſſing;</hi> which yet (as we ſaid) God hath annexed to His determination of a <hi>Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath</hi> for the chiefe Time for Religion, even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But without ſuch expreſſe and particular determination from God, (or an expreſſe <hi>promiſe of Bleſſing</hi> on the proportion which men, or the Church ſhall determine, whatever it be; which is no where to be found in Scripture:) We have no manner of ground to conceit a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> on any proportion of <hi>Time</hi> that can be determined by men for Religion, to make that <hi>ſufficient</hi> for mens ſoules. A <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> we ſay, beyond the proportion of that which might be expected from ſo long and ſo often attendance on Religion; a multiplying Bleſſing, in the nature of Chriſts <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> the five loaves, and two fiſhes, to feed more (by many) then the naturall proportion could poſſibly give hopes of. So that the attendance on God <hi>one Day in ſeven</hi> (which is the Time in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) ſhall be <hi>bleſſed</hi> beyond an ordinary Dayes ſervice, (if it were not ſpecially appointed by God) and have a ſtronger influence on all the other ſixe Dayes of the Week following, then could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſo much <hi>Time</hi> ſpent in Religion, ſimply conſidered, as ſo much Time. And without ſuch a Bleſſing, (upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated <hi>ſolemne Time</hi>) the ſoule would ſtill be leane, hungry, and even ſtarve for want of a <hi>ſufficient proportion of Time,</hi> by reaſon of its manifold continuall neceſſities, faintings, decayes, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. So that whatever our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> diſpute againſt the Commandement of God, we conceive they diſpute againſt their

                  <hi>own participation of a Bleſſing</hi> upon whatſoever <hi>Time</hi> is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and obſerved by men, themſelves or others; And that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer <hi>Bleſſing</hi> may be reſted on, in the <hi>obſervation of one Day in ſeven,</hi> as from Gods determination, then in <hi>two Dayes</hi> in ſeven, three Dayes, nay ſixe Dayes in ſeven, at mans appointment. For here ſtill would be uncertainty, whether this proportion were <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient:</hi> But Gods command (which in all His Ordinances hath eternally a Bleſſing annexed to the right obſervers) is <hi>ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> to convey a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and make a <hi>ſufficiencie</hi> for the <hi>chiefe Time;</hi> in which Conſciences may abundantly reſt and ſatisfie themſelves. And this we are fully perſwaded, God meant to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to us, when, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. at the firſt mention of His conſecrating a <hi>ſolemne Time,</hi> He ſaith, <hi>[The Lord bleſſed the ſeventh Day, and ſanctified it.]</hi> A <hi>Day,</hi> (or any other ſuch creature) is capable of no other <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> then to be made a <hi>meanes of Bleſſing</hi> to the right uſers of it according to Gods command.

Though we cannot tell how to conceive the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> without the <hi>Sanctification</hi> going before, or at leaſt concurrent: yet God to ſhew more abundantly his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and graciouſneſſe both in challenging this <hi>proportion</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of <hi>one Day</hi> in ſeven, and allowing by His <hi>indulgence</hi> ſixe Dayes of ſeven for worldly occaſions, He puts the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and ſo He doth alſo <hi>remarkably</hi> in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: where having expreſly allowed the <hi>indulgence</hi> of ſix Dayes for worldly work; after He had challenged a <hi>ſeventh Day</hi> for a <hi>Sabbath</hi> for Himſelfe, He repeats His own example of ſixe Dayes work, and then His <hi>bleſſing a Sabbath</hi> (a ſeventh Day) and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it. Why ſo? but to aſſure us, that a happy <hi>Bleſſing</hi> ſhould attend the conſcionable obſervation of this <hi>Sabbath</hi> of one Day in ſeven, that though it were ſo little a <hi>proportion,</hi> yet it ſhould be <hi>ordinarily ſufficient for the chiefe Time;</hi> And all the ſixe Dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>revolutions</hi> of this <hi>Sabbath one Day in ſeven,</hi> ſhould taſte of the <hi>good</hi> gotten on that Day; The ſtrength of it laſting in mens ſoules from <hi>Sabbath</hi> to <hi>Sabbath,</hi> (with a little of each Day beſides, as was ſaid formerly:) and they ſhould by it princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally

grow in grace, and ſpirituall comfort in God towards eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; notwithſtanding all their ordinary and great <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> of worldly buſineſſes on the Working Dayes.</p>
               <p>And upon this, we have, as it ſeems to us,<note place="margin">LXXII. The Text of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.2. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> a clear &amp; pertinent commentator &amp; interpreter (as we toucht before) and that in two Chapters of his Propheſie, towards the latter end; where he is much, if not altogether, upon the <hi>Times</hi> of the Goſpel.

In the former place, calling all ſorts to Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the <hi>obſervation</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> he begins with [<hi>Bleſſed is the man that doth this, and the ſon of man that layes hold on it, that keeps the Sabbath from polluting it,</hi> v. 2.] Then encouraging the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> though perſons under a kind of legall curſe in thoſe dayes, to this obſervation; he promiſeth them from God, <hi>[an everlaſting name, (better then of ſons and of daughters) a name which ſhould not be cut off:]</hi> that is, a ſpirituall bleſſing on their ſoules, and an owning them for His true and faithfull ſervants, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5. And againe, encouraging the ſtrangers (the Heathen, outwardly as yet without the Covenant of Grace) to come in, and ſanctifie the Sabbath; he promiſes (in Gods name) [<hi>That they ſhould be made joyfull in Gods houſe of Prayer, and their ſervices accepted by Him,</hi> v. 3, 6, 7.] So that ſpirituall comfort in God, and His gracious acceptation of their ſervices, is the bleſſing promiſed to the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obſervance</hi> of this <hi>Time</hi> appointed by God for the <hi>chiefe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Time</hi> of His Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Neither can this be eluded by our <hi>Diſputers,</hi> (as they offer to <label type="milestone">

This will not hurt our interpretation of this place, ſince the difference is apparant enough, between His calling for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that which is ſo ſubſtantially neceſſary (in the kind of it) to Religion; that is, either this <hi>Proportion</hi> determined for the <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> or ſome other; and that which is plainly a <hi>figure</hi> and a type, as all burnt offerings and materiall ſacrifices were, Of which kind there are now none ſuch under the Goſpel.

But we have ſhewed our grounds of difference, enough, between theſe two, in point of ſubſtance and neceſſity to Religion, one Day in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that ſeventh Day. And what needs more to be ſaid, we ſhall adde, when hereafter we ſhall come to ſhew (as we have promiſed it, and are forced to repeat it, oftener then we would) that the <hi>ſeventh Day was not directly commanded in the words of the fourth Commandement,</hi> nor at all as the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and particular matter of them. But only within the <hi>generall ſcope,</hi> as then appointed by God (elſewhere) and ſo our <hi>Lords-day</hi> comes equally within it, and is now become <hi>ſucceſſour</hi> to it in the particular title to the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> as we ſhall ſee.

               <p>
                  <hi>[If all Time be Gods, and none ours for worldly imployments, but by His indulgence; Then the particular Day (or Dayes) for the chiefe Time to Religion, belongs to Gods peculiar determination, and not to mens. But all Time is Gods, and none ours for worldly imployments, but by His indulgence.</hi> Ergo, <hi>The particular Day (or Dayes) for the chiefe Time to Religion, belongs to Gods peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar determination, and not to mens.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> cannot be denyed, and hath been ſufficiently
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:112963:171"/>
illuſtrated in the foregoing <hi>Parallel</hi> Argument.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conſequence</hi> of this may alſo be cleared: If we conſider, 1. That how ever this be no ſuch matter of <hi>importance</hi> in Religion in the eſſentiall part of it, as the former was; yet even this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes in ſome ſort the <hi>Soveraignity</hi> of God, ſo far as we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it: Unleſſe He had fully and clearely expreſt himſelfe (which we no where find in His Word) to have put over the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of this Particularity</hi> to men. 2. That an <hi>indulgence</hi> to men, of ſo much Time, ſo often for their <hi>worldly imployments,</hi> (as of ſixe Dayes in ſeven) doth not yet, in the nature of it, allow them to be their own <hi>Carvers</hi> in the particular Dayes: But they muſt wait upon Gods <hi>particular allowance</hi> of the particular Dayes, before they may preſume to imploy any of them at all to their own worldly occaſions. The <hi>order,</hi> as well as the <hi>proportion,</hi> is in <hi>Gods</hi> hand originally, and He puts not the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of that out of His hand, without an <hi>expreſſe declaration</hi> of ſo much, particularly, or at leaſt generally. (As <hi>Lawyers</hi> ſay of the <hi>King,</hi> that <hi>He paſſes away none of his rights, in any grant, by doubtfull and ambiguous words.</hi>) If but a maſter ſay to his ſervant or ſcholar, or a parent to his child: <hi>I will allow you ſo many houres for your ſelfe,</hi> (your own buſineſſe, or ſport, &amp;c.) <hi>and ſo much Time you ſhall attend your booke, and my buſineſſe, this Day, or any Day:</hi> Will any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſuch ſervant, ſcholar, or child, may take thoſe houres to himſelfe, when he liſts himſelfe; though he ſhould attend on this maſter or parent the reſt of the Time? For this would ſhew, that <hi>himſelfe,</hi> rather then his ſuperior, were the <hi>Lord</hi> and commander of his Time; and ſo be an act of <hi>preſumption;</hi> as if alſo his <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> were rather beholden to him for affording to give ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him at all, then he to his ſuperior for his <hi>indulgence</hi> of ſo much Time, (when he could have challenged none at all; all being his ſuperiors, none his own) for his private occaſions. Let this be thought upon, and it cannot well be denyed, but it is a proper peece of <hi>ſoveraigntie,</hi> (even of all <hi>ſuperioritie</hi>) to retaine the appointment of the particular Times for the chiefe attendance of inferiors upon them, in their own hands; and a part of the <hi>naturall homage</hi> ſuch owe to their ſuperiors, to depend upon their expreſſe <hi>pleaſure</hi> for the particularities of the <hi>chiefe Times</hi> of ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as well as for the <hi>proportion</hi> of ſuch Times. A <hi>Lord</hi> even
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:112963:171"/>
of a <hi>Manour</hi> uſes to reſerve this authority in his own hands, That his Courts, when all his homagers ſhall be bound to doe their ſuit and ſervice to him, ſhall be at his calling, and not at the <hi>Tenants</hi> pleaſure, either extraordinarily or ordinarily. How much more is this a <hi>Royaltie</hi> beſeeming the <hi>LORD-Paramount of Heaven &amp; Earth!</hi> We conclude then this Argument with this admonition, That our <hi>Diſputers</hi> would but root out that <hi>pernicious thought,</hi> which we feare they are deeply tainted with, <hi>That Time is now rather our own, than Gods.</hi> And then we make no doubt but they will readily yield both the <hi>chiefe Time</hi> for His Worſhip, and the <hi>particular Dayes</hi> for it, to belong eternally to His <hi>determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and all diſputes between them and us will ſuddenly be at an end.</p>
               <p>We confirme this Argument by a ſecond,<note place="margin">LXXVI. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Upon that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends Gods bleſſing.</note> neere of kin to the former, ſutable alſo to our foregoing diſcourſes for the <hi>chiefe Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[If we ſtand in need of a Bleſſing from God upon the proportion of Time which we obſerve for the ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion: Then the determination of the very particular Day belongs to God peculiarly, and not to men. But, we ſtand in need of a Bleſſing from God upon the proportion of Time which we obſerve for the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient chiefe Time for Religion.</hi> Ergo, <hi>The determination of the very particular Day belongs to God peculiarly, and not to men.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> hath been ſufficiently confirmed before. The <hi>Conſequence</hi> may be proved, by conſidering, 1. That the <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> cannot be regularly obſerved, but by the <hi>determination of a particular Day for it.</hi> 2. That men have no power to annexe <hi>Gods bleſſing</hi> to any determination of theirs. That comes <hi>freely</hi> from Gods own will and pleaſure, from His <hi>meere grace,</hi> which men cannot ſo much as know, without He reveale it himſelfe by way of Promiſe or Covenant; which He doth to His <hi>own ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> but no where to mens ordinances, that is, to any ſuch <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations</hi> of men, as are intended obligatory to others,<note place="margin">N. B.</note> or for any permanencie. We adde this <hi>explication,</hi> becauſe we find, that God did, for a <hi>ſingle act,</hi> allow His people, even after His own <hi>Altar</hi> was made, to build an Altar for ſacrifice to Him upon a ſpeciall occaſion, of earth, or of whole ſtones. But they were not to make a <hi>cuſtome</hi> of uſing that Altar, and therefore the materials
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:112963:172"/>
of it were to be looſe. Alſo in the <hi>Paſſeover, Exod.</hi> 12. God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particular perſons (according to their ſtore) to take a <hi>Lambe,</hi> or a <hi>Kid;</hi> but not that He allowed the <hi>Elders</hi> to enjoyne all to one ſort, nor was he that now uſed a <hi>Kid</hi> obliged to it the next turne. But here the <hi>particular Day</hi> in queſtion is to be determined for many, (indeed for <hi>all mankind,</hi> as the next Argument will offer proofe of) and ſo to be <hi>oligatorie,</hi> and accordingly to be at leaſt for ſome while <hi>permanent;</hi> For it were both altogether ridiculous, &amp; would bring forth manifold <hi>confuſions,</hi> to be every 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. turn or <hi>revolution,</hi> changing the particular Day. Therefore we ſay, no ſuch <hi>permanent and obligatorie determination</hi> hath any promiſe of <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> unleſſe it be the <hi>determination</hi> and ordinance of God himſelfe. Now upon the particular determination of the <hi>Day,</hi> or the particular Day determined, the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> doth fall (though not properly for the <hi>particular Dayes</hi> ſake, but for the <hi>Proportions,</hi> to make that <hi>ſufficient</hi> to be obſerved for the <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> as hath been ſaid.) Accordingly then, that <hi>particular Day,</hi> to make it capable and ſuſceptible of the <hi>Bleſſing;</hi> that is, that the <hi>obſervers</hi> of that particular Day may enjoy the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> promiſed to the obſervers of the <hi>chiefe Time,</hi> that <hi>particular Day</hi> muſt not be determined by men, but by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">LXXVII. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. It is very fit, all the world ſhould have one and the ſame day, as neere as may be.</note>A third Argument to like purpoſe, (of which alſo <hi>touches</hi> have been formerly given, but we conceive it convenient to be here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly handled) is from the more then conveniencie, (neere to a neceſſitie, if not altogether ſo) that there ſhould be <hi>one particular Day,</hi> as neere as may be, according to the variation of <hi>Climates,</hi> even the <hi>ſelfe-ſame Day,</hi> all the world over, for the <hi>Honour</hi> of God generally from all His ſervants together at the ſame time; and for the <hi>generall exerciſe of the Communion of Saints</hi> alſo all the world over. Thus we propound it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[If all the world over there is to be, as neere as may be, one and the ſelf-ſame particular day for the chief time to Religion: Then the determination of this particular Day belongs to God peculiarly, and not to men. But there is to be all the world over, as neere as may be, one and the ſelfe-ſame particular Day for the chiefe Time for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Ergo, <hi>The determination of this particular Day belongs to God peculiarly, and not to men.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Conſequence</hi> of this Argument is evident, 1. By the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:112963:172"/>
neceſſity</hi> of having a <hi>particular Day</hi> determined for the <hi>chiefe Time</hi> to Religion; ſo as, if any ſuch <hi>particular Day</hi> which was <hi>once determined</hi> for it be abrogated (upon any grounds whatſoever) there muſt without delay be a <hi>new particular Day</hi> determined, as without which the <hi>chiefe Time neceſſary to Religion</hi> cannot be obſerved by all thoſe whom it concernes, by all Chriſtians. 2. By the <hi>Impoſſibilitie,</hi> that without a <hi>Divine determination,</hi> or at leaſt a divine <hi>revelation,</hi> all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> could ſo much as come to know <hi>what Day, particularly,</hi> were determined by all, that know of the <hi>abrogation</hi> of the former particular Day before them: As ſuppoſe, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> going into ſeverall Countries, and preaching the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation</hi> of the <hi>old ſeventh Day,</hi> and that a <hi>new Day</hi> was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the <hi>Church:</hi> and that <hi>Matthew</hi> goes firſt, and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> after him, and <hi>Bartholomew</hi> after him; how can the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to whom <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Bartholomew</hi> preach thus, know, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>divine revelation, what Day</hi> is determined by the <hi>Churches</hi> that made the firſt <hi>determination,</hi> namely thoſe to whom <hi>Matthew</hi> preached. 3. By a like <hi>impoſſibilitie</hi> of their knowing what the Churches that ſhould receive the Goſpel after them, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine concerning the <hi>particular Day;</hi> as namely, to whom (ſuppoſe) <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> ſhould preach, after the others. 4. The <hi>impoſſibilitie,</hi> that they would all agree upon the ſame Time, though they did know one anothers minds; unleſſe ſome <hi>command</hi> from God did neceſſitate the latter converted Churches to conſent to the determination of the firſt Churches; and this ſuppoſed, would to them be in the nature of a <hi>divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,</hi> and would ſuppoſe an <hi>inſpiration</hi> from God to have aſſiſted the <hi>determination</hi> by thoſe Churches. 5. Of this, the great and violent <hi>difference,</hi> even preſently after the Apoſtles times, <hi>about the keeping of Eaſter day,</hi> (upon the particular Day of the Week, or the particular Day of the Moneth) between the <hi>Weſtern</hi> and <hi>Eaſterne</hi> Churches, ſhewes proofe ſufficient, namely, how little hope or poſſibilitie there would have been even in the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times,</hi> of the agreement about the <hi>particular Day</hi> for the <hi>chiefe Time</hi> to Religion, (and ſo much rather now) if wholly left to the <hi>determination</hi> of men, of the <hi>Church,</hi> Particular, or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Churches, or any. 6.

(to ſay the leaſt of it) to the <hi>very Law of Nature</hi> that it ſhould be ſo. Which makes us the more admire, at ſome (at leaſt) of our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> diſputing, <hi>as if the preſent Church had power to alter the Lords day, to any other day of the Weeke,</hi> And what Church they meane, <hi>Nationall?</hi> or <hi>Vniverſall?</hi> (which, to be ſure, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meate ſo much as repreſentatively, if we include all Chriſtians of <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa, and America</hi> within the univerſall Church) Or what they intend by it?

               <argument>
                  <p>Two Corollaries from the former Diſcourſes about <hi>Solemn Time. 1.</hi> All Times and Dayes are not equall under the Goſpel. <hi>2.</hi> Time and Place are not equall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in Religion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is found by experience, That <hi>Truth ſometimes is as much (or more) prejudiced by ſome common Sentences, which have ſome ſhew of probabilitie or veritie in them, as by the ſtrongeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentations againſt it.</hi> Becauſe <hi>theſe</hi> are only confined to the Diſcourſes and Writings of learned men, and are formally and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently oppoſed by the <hi>Patrons</hi> of Truth: But <hi>thoſe</hi> are uſually toſſed up and down among all ſorts, and paſſe for the moſt part without examination, and ſo doe great hurt inſenſibly. Therefore it is, that thoſe who would effectually <hi>vindicate an oppoſed Truth,</hi> muſt as well take ſome paines to encounter ſuch <hi>common ſayings,</hi> even diſtinctly and expreſly as any other contradicting Arguments: applying to them (without feare of being counted <hi>Tautologiſts</hi>) ſuch Reaſons as are laid down even in other places, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any other that are particular and proper; ſo to diſcover fully the <hi>falſitie</hi> and danger of thoſe <hi>vulgar Conceits</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">I. Two Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries from the former Diſcourſe.</note>The thought of this hath made us eſteeme it neceſſary to beſtow this <hi>Chapter</hi> entirely upon the examination of two <hi>common Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which ſerve our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> at every turne almoſt. 1. <hi>[That all Dayes and Times</hi> (they ſay) <hi>are alike, and equall under the Goſpel.</hi> 2. <hi>That Time and Place are equall circumſtances in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.]</hi> Which have been ſo commonly agitated, not only in all Writings of theirs in this Subject, (though without any judicious and exact ſcanning) but in vulgar diſcourſes; that they are grown to be in a ſort <hi>Proverbs</hi> among them: Inſomuch as we find, that the latter of theſe hath in ſome ſort <hi>tainted</hi> ſome, even of thoſe who yet are <hi>Orthodox,</hi> in the maine, about <hi>Solemne Time:</hi> ſo that even they ſpeak the ſame language, now and then, of an <hi>Equalitie of Time and Place.</hi> All which conſtrained us to take in hand a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conſideration</hi> of both theſe forementioned <hi>Aſſertions:</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:112963:179"/>
And though we muſt of neceſſity ſay over ſome of thoſe things we have ſpoken already; and touch ſome others beforehand, whoſe proper place to argue fully comes hereafter: yet we rather chooſe to doe ſo, (though ſome ſhould call it <hi>tautologizing</hi>) than for want of a <hi>formall ſetting</hi> our ſelves againſt thoſe <hi>fallacious Principles,</hi> to leave ſuch prejudiciall conceits in the mindes of any Readers. To begin with the firſt then—</p>
               <p>Our Poſition is,<note place="margin">II. The firſt. All Times and Dayes are not equall.</note> 
                  <hi>[All Times and Dayes are not equall under the Goſpel.]</hi> The <hi>Contradictory</hi> whereunto had wont to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded as an <hi>Anabaptiſticall fancy:</hi> But now of late, among the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputers</hi> concerning the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Lords day,</hi> it hath gotten ſome more <hi>venerable fautors.</hi> And which addes to the ſtrangeneſſe, even thoſe that cry it down in the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſay as much as they in ſenſe, and neere their very words. So that there is little or no <hi>difference</hi> between them, and the other, whom they would ſeem to oppoſe; Except it be, that our <hi>Diſputers</hi> give ſomewhat more to the <hi>Churches power</hi> about <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Dayes,</hi> than the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> allow. But that we may refute both the one, and the other,<note place="margin">III. The queſtion ſtated, by ſhewing,</note> in their erroneous expreſſions, or meanings; We will firſt a little ſtate the Queſtion now before us; and then declare our <hi>Grounds</hi> oppoſite to their <hi>Aſſertions;</hi> and finally, give a touch of <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to their chiefeſt ſtrength from the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which may ſeem to favour them. But all briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is true, <hi>[That all Times and Dayes, in themſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</note> 
                  <hi>as Times and Dayes, materially conſidered, are equall, and of the very ſame nature.]</hi> One not more <hi>excellent,</hi> more <hi>holy,</hi> more <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be obſerved to Religion, than another: that is, <hi>antecedent</hi> to all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of God, or in <hi>ſenſu diviſo.</hi> So that the learned Biſhop ſpeaks right in this, <q>[Every day of the week had one and the ſame efficient cauſe, namely, Divine creation:<note place="margin">B. of E. p. <hi>34.</hi>
                     </note> And all times and things created by God, were very good.]</q> But if they ſo ſtate the Queſtion, the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and they, and we, are all agreed; They have no Adverſary in this Cauſe. But yet this is nothing; For they may as well ſay this of all Times and Dayes under the <hi>Law,</hi> as under the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> That all were <hi>materially equall,</hi> and in themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. By the Sun-riſing, or ſetting, no <hi>Theologicall difference</hi> appeared in any of them, no more than now. Here then lies no ſcruple.</p>

So that we may do our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> all the faire right that may be in the point, we will firſt of all ſcanne, all the <hi>profit</hi> or <hi>neceſſity</hi> that can poſſibly be pretended to be in <hi>Place,</hi> ſome <hi>Place,</hi> or any <hi>Place,</hi> toward Religion, wherein it equallizes <hi>Time</hi> any way. Whereby alſo they (and all Readers) we hope, will ſee by how <hi>ſlender matters</hi> they have been abuſed, to make them proclaime in ſuch ſort, as they do continually, the <hi>equallitie of Time and Place in Religion.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">XVII. Place how neceſſary to Religion. 1. Naturally or Phyſically.</note>The <hi>neceſſitie of Place</hi> may be reduced to three Conſiderations, all reſpecting properly the <hi>body,</hi> and none of them the <hi>mind</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which yet is principally employed in Religion. Frrſt, there is a <hi>Naturall, Phyſicall neceſſitie</hi> of ſome <hi>Place</hi> for every Religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather for every bodily creature to be in, during its actions. Even <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> being creatures and finite, though not corporeall, have their <hi>Place,</hi> (their <hi>Vbi</hi> as Philoſophers call it) wherein they are; and out of which they are not at that Time.</p>
               <p>And all bodies have beſides, both <hi>Locum Internum,</hi> which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates their bodies, as alſo an <hi>Exteriour Place,</hi> within the ayre or water (or <hi>viz.</hi>) which by a <hi>naturall phyſicall neceſſitie</hi> they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and take up and fill; namely a <hi>Place</hi> proportionable alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to their own bigneſſe, for length, breadth, and heighth. And this they never change, while the bodyes are the ſame; This <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Place</hi> is immutable, being naturally fitted to their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, how ever the bodies move from Place, to Place, in regard of their <hi>Vbi.</hi> Now if we take <hi>Place</hi> in this conſideration, there is indeed an <hi>equallity between it and Time</hi> in Religion (or any other buſineſſe or action,) both are neceſſary, <hi>phyſically,</hi> as we ſay, that is, <hi>inevitably,</hi> whether we think of them or no, whether we will or no. No man (no creature) can rid himſelf of the <hi>company of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:112963:185"/>
Time and Place. (Eſſe cum tempore, &amp; Eſſe in loco;</hi> are as inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>adjuncts,</hi> as their own very being.) But this is ſuch a <hi>weake conſideration,</hi> as we ſhould be aſhamed to mention it in a ſerious diſcourſe, but that we find our <hi>Diſputers,</hi> even ſeriouſly holding this forth, as a <hi>remarkable equallity</hi> between <hi>Time and Place in Religion, that nothing can be done without ſome Place, as nothing without ſome Time,</hi> and that this ſhould inſinuate them both alike, and of equall importance. Whereas in true and ſober underſtanding neither the one nor the other, come at all into a <hi>Religious conſideration</hi> in this ſence. Vertue nor Vice, Ethically or Morally, (and much leſſe Theologically or Religiouſly) having no manner of <hi>relation</hi> to ſuch <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> or ſuch <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> to them. Therefore we diſmiſſe this conſideration as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> in our diſcourſe: but that our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputers</hi> wiſdome, or Philoſophicall naturall (not morall) reaſon hath laid a neceſſity upon us to ſay thus much of it, that it may no more hereafter be talked of in this controverſie.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecond <hi>neceſſity naturall of Place</hi> to humane actions;<note place="margin">XVIII. 2. Vitally.</note> Religious, or Civil, which we may call <hi>vitall,</hi> or <hi>medicinall,</hi> that is, that the proportion of the <hi>Place,</hi> wherein one Prayes (or many) or tenders any ſervice to God, be of ſo large a compaſſe for length bredth and heighth, as that a man may have roome to breath, and that his limmes and members of his body be not ſo cruſhed or crowded, as thereby his <hi>life or health</hi> ſhould be violated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered. From whence followes a neceſſity of a <hi>larger Place</hi> for many, then for one, or few. Now in this conſideration alſo, we will not deny an <hi>equallity between Place and Time. Place</hi> muſt not prejudice the life or health by the ſtraightneſſe. No more may <hi>Time,</hi> by its over long <hi>Continuance,</hi> or too much <hi>Frequency,</hi> for any Religious duty, or any thing towards it, <hi>watching, faſting,</hi> or the like. But this kind of neceſſity is rather <hi>Negative</hi> then <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> in true conſtruction, and is not for Religion properly in a Morall or Theologicall conſideration, as was noted before, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>naturall, vitall, medicinall,</hi> reſpecting the bodily ſpirits, and but indirectly the mind or ſoul. And therefore we need not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply more words of it.</p>
               <p>Meane time we have a third <hi>naturall neceſſitie</hi> to conſider,<note place="margin">XIX. 3. Animally, or ſenſitively.</note> which we may call <hi>animal,</hi> or <hi>ſenſitive;</hi> namely, that the <hi>Place</hi> where
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:112963:186"/>
one is met with others to worſhip God, be ſo <hi>large</hi> for roome, and ſo ordered for <hi>neerneſſe</hi> to him that is to ſpeake, (whether in <hi>Prayer</hi> to God for all the reſt, or out of the Word, by <hi>Reading</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> to all the reſt) as that all and every one may be able to <hi>heare,</hi> whatſoever is ſpoken. And this conſideration once more <hi>equallizes Place and Time.</hi> This being like to the neceſſity of <hi>light Time,</hi> (whether Naturall of the Day light, or artificiall of Candles, Lampes, Torches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that all may both read, that can read, and beſides may know to behave themſelves <hi>orderly</hi> in the ſervice of God, and may partake of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in a fitting and <hi>decent</hi> manner. But againe this conſideration, is rather <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or Privative, then <hi>Poſitive;</hi> and though drawing neerer to Religion then either of the two former; yet being not properly a neceſſity <hi>Theologicall</hi> or <hi>Morall,</hi> but <hi>animall and ſenſitive,</hi> the Senſes not ſerving but within ſuch a <hi>diſtance,</hi> and with ſuch <hi>helpe:</hi> Whereas <hi>Religion</hi> is chiefely exerciſed in the mind, and may be <hi>(ſolitarily)</hi> without any preſent uſe of the Senſes; and when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, the <hi>Senſes</hi> are accomodated with fit <hi>Place, and Time,</hi> the mind perhaps is wholly <hi>irreligious.</hi> So that here is a very ſmall matter toward Religion, affirmatively and certainly, by all this <hi>neceſſary Place</hi> had and obſerved. And yet this is all the <hi>neceſſity to Religion,</hi> that we can conceive, that <hi>Place</hi> in it ſelfe conſidered, (and Antecedent to all command of God, of which by and by) is capable of, in any reſpect relating to <hi>Gods Worſhip,</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> of mens Soules: as we ſhall ſee more anon.</p>

not by Gods command any ſuch thing in that <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> where they met, but were in the <hi>open ayre,</hi> lyable to raine and ſtormes, as appeares (beſides the evidence of other proofes) by <hi>Ezr.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.13.

Whereunto we may adde, the <hi>conveniency</hi> of fitting <hi>ſeates,</hi> and <hi>galleryes,</hi> and windowes for more light, and ſuch like accommodations; and the <hi>Places</hi> of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Worſhip being not <hi>too farre</hi> from the dwellings of thoſe that are to have recourſe to it. And like unto this <hi>accidentall profit of Places,</hi> is the accidentall profit of <hi>Time</hi> heretofore noted, namely the <hi>ſeaſons of Time,</hi> as that the publike Worſhip, particularly be not <hi>too early,</hi> nor <hi>too late,</hi> in the morning, or at night, whereby men would be apt to be ſleepy, or drowſie, nor too <hi>long continued</hi> in the extremities of heat or cold, which would dull mens <hi>devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or that perſons could not come from, and returne to their dwellings, in convenient times.

               <p n="2">2. Another <hi>accidentall convenience</hi> (or profit,<note place="margin">XXI. 2.

               <p>Only firſt, let us but premiſe two or three differences, even in Nature, between <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place:</hi> which though perhaps at the firſt view they may ſeem but ſleight; yet upon ſecond thoughts, they may poſſibly be counted worthy the noting, as foreboding
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:112963:189"/>
(as we may ſay) the greater and more remarkable differences in Religion. Firſt then, <hi>Place,</hi> our Place, is <hi>terrenum quid,</hi> an earthly kind of thing; we being on earth, its foundation is on earth, and is defined by an <hi>earthly body,</hi> of which it is the <hi>ſuperficies:</hi> And accordingly, as we have already ſaid, it hath only properly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the body, and bodily conveniences. But <hi>Time</hi> is <hi>coeleſte quid,</hi> a kind of heavenly thing; whoſe foundation is in heaven, being derived from thence, from the motion of the celeſtiall orbes and heavenly lampes of light; being meaſured by them, and being the meaſure of them. And accordingly, it is proper to helpe us forward toward heaven. 2. <hi>Place is, quiddam craſſum &amp; materiale,</hi> a kind of groſſe and materiall thing; and ſo only concernes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies convenience directly, which is a materiall ſubſtance. But <hi>Time</hi> is <hi>quiddam immateriale &amp; ſpiritale,</hi> as we may ſay, a kind of ſpirituall and immateriall thing; and ſo hath a more proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the mind, ſoule and ſpirit. 3. <hi>Place</hi> is in its owne nature, <hi>fixum &amp; immobile quid;</hi> a fixed, ſetled, ſteady thing, which moves not; and ſo leſſe care is required about it, the ſame <hi>Place</hi> that ſerves conveniently for one buſineſſe, will often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care taking ſerve for another, the ſame Hall or Houſe for divers kinds of <hi>Councells</hi> at ſeverall Times. But <hi>Time</hi> is <hi>mobile &amp; fluidum quid,</hi> a fleeting fleeing thing, that ſlides away ſilently like a river without noyſe; and ſo the ſame <hi>particular Time,</hi> in any of the reſpects, is irrecoverably loſt, if ſlipt and neglected; and accordingly if good care be not taken about <hi>Time,</hi> the whole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or buſineſſe comes thereby to be diſordered and marred. So that even in Nature (to begin with) the differences are apparent between theſe two, <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place;</hi> and ſo in Civill or Artificiall actions they are not <hi>equall.</hi>

               <p>

                  <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. It is Gods portion <hi>Ergo,</hi> a part of worſhip.</note> 
                  <hi>as His peculiar portion, is a part of worſhip. But the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion, together with the particular Day for it, is that Time which God requires out of all our Time, as His peculiar portion.</hi> Ergo, <hi>It is a part of worſhip.]</hi> The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is made good by inſtances of other things, which being challenged by God as His <hi>peculiar portion,</hi> became thereby <hi>parts of worſhip,</hi> parts of the ſpeciall <hi>Homage</hi> due to Him, immediately tending to His <hi>Honour.</hi> As, 1. The <hi>Place</hi> which God did peculiarly chuſe out of all the Tribes, to ſet His name there, (as the <hi>Place</hi> often is) the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Lords Temple,</hi> was by vertue of ſuch Divine challenge of it, a <hi>part of worſhip, (ſc.</hi> of the Ceremoniall worſhip) unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably; and the preſenting there their ſervices, was a ſpeciall part of the Jewes <hi>homage</hi> to God, and an immediate honour to Him; as alſo a matter of ſpeciall <hi>acceptation</hi> with God, (even ſo far, as that no other legall ſervices were otherwhere acceptable at all, except upon <hi>extraordinary command,</hi> as <hi>Elijahs</hi> was, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.) And if it were ſo with <hi>Place</hi> then, there can be no reaſon but it is ſo with <hi>Time</hi> now, though not now in a <hi>typicall reſpect,</hi> but <hi>morall,</hi> whether naturall, or poſitive, it is all one. 2. So was it alſo of old with the <hi>Tithes,</hi> which God challenges as His <hi>peculiar portion</hi> out of every mans ſubſtance, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.30, 32. It is ſaid, <hi>They are the Lords,</hi> His part, His <hi>tribute.</hi> And ſo the payment of them was a ſpeciall <hi>Homage</hi> to Him, an immediate <hi>Honour,</hi> a <hi>part of worſhip.</hi> And that (which is ſpecially to be noted) antecedent to any <hi>particular uſe</hi> which He meant to put them to, and whereto He did afterward apply them, <hi>ſc.</hi> the maintenance of His Prieſts &amp; Levites.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:112963:198"/>
For this we read not of, till <hi>Num.</hi> 18. which was divers yeers after. Whereupon it is there (and elſewhere) ſaid, <hi>That the Lord is the portion of Levi;</hi> that is, <hi>Levi</hi> ſhould enjoy the <hi>Lords portion of Tithes,</hi> as alſo of Offerings. But this uſe of them was ſecondary, and we doe not ſay, that in this conſidration the payment of them was <hi>properly Worſhip.</hi> For it was not immediately to <hi>Gods honour,</hi> but only mediate, in as much as thoſe <hi>Levites</hi> that were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them, were Gods <hi>Miniſters.</hi> That which made them <hi>Parts</hi> of Worſhip, was antecedent, as we ſaid, to this; Namely, Gods challenging them as <hi>His portion,</hi> His own primarily and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally, (though now making the <hi>Levites His receivers.</hi>) Hence the witholding them, is called <hi>robbing of God,</hi> (not defrauding or robbing the <hi>Levites) Mal.</hi> 3. And if we underſtand aright, This is that <hi>Sacrilege</hi> mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. where, after the Apoſtle had twice ſaid, <hi>Thou breakeſt the ſame Commandements thou teacheſt others not to break;</hi> Stealing, and committing Adulterie: he adds, <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols</hi> (or Images) <hi>doſt thou commit Sacriledge? Doſt thou break the ſame Commandement,</hi> viz. the ſecond, robbing God of <hi>part</hi> of His Worſhip, by detaining <hi>His portion of Tithes?</hi> However, to be ſure, they were His portion formerly, and ſo a part of His worſhip. 3. And ſo was that ſhare which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to Himſelfe out of the <hi>Midianites</hi> ſpoiles,<note place="margin">The Lords Heave-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>v.</hi> 29.41.</note> 
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 31. which is called the <hi>Lords tribute,</hi> the <hi>Lords portion:</hi> And was His, a part of <hi>homage</hi> to Him, a part of His worſhip on that occaſion, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to the <hi>ſpeciall uſe.</hi> He afterward allotted that alſo to be diſpoſed of by <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt, as we there read. Now if theſe things by this meanes became <hi>parts of Worſhip:</hi> So is it in reaſon, with that <hi>Time</hi> which God challenges as His <hi>tribute</hi> or peculiar portion out of all our Time; It muſt be a <hi>part of Worſhip,</hi> in that it is His, allotted to His <hi>Honour,</hi> antecedent to any particular uſes which it is put to, to any particular Duties of Worſhip, which yet become the imployment of it; Namely one or other of them, or more than one, even all the varieties of Duties, doe actually imploy this <hi>Time</hi> unto Gods <hi>Honour.</hi> But antecedent, we ſay, to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Duties, the <hi>Time</hi> being Gods, His <hi>portion,</hi> is to His Honour immediately, and a part of Worſhip, and conſequently calling for ſome particular Duties of Worſhip, to help imploy it to <hi>Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> In a word, Though it cannot be actually imployed to <hi>Gods
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:112963:198"/>
Honour,</hi> without ſome <hi>particular Duties;</hi> yet hath it a diſtinct conſideration abſtracted from the <hi>Duties:</hi> As requiring and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for, and even commanding (as we ſaid formerly of <hi>Solemne Time</hi> in generall) <hi>Duties</hi> to attend it, ſome or other. And ſo is diſtinctly, by, and of it ſelfe, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of God immediately, as well as the <hi>Duties</hi> themſelves, though not actually ſeparated from all. For that is a contradiction in Religion, to ſay, <hi>[That a Time can be to Gods honour, and not be imployed in ſome Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties or other.]</hi> But we have ſaid enough, as we conceive, to illuſtrate and evince the Propoſition of our Argument, <hi>That the Time which is Gods portion, is a part of VVorſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Aſſumption, <hi>[That the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion, is the Time, which (together with the particular Day for it) God requires out of all our Time, out of all mens Time, as His peculiar portion]</hi> that is, above all other Time, hath been proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in the foregoing Chapters, 9. &amp; 10. And this we alſo conceived to be meant in thoſe words of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>The ſeventh Day, or a ſeventh Day, one Day of ſeven is the Sabbath, or a Sabbath of the Lord thy God, or to the Lord thy God;</hi> namely, <hi>That he being the Lord of all thy Time,</hi> (as of all things elſe that are thine.) hath reſerved to Himſelf, and challenges for Himſelf, (while He allowes thee ſix Dayes mainly for thy wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And like to this, as we conceive, is the meaning, in the New Teſtament, of the terme <hi>of the Lords Day,</hi> it is the particular Day which he hath taken and challenges to Himſelf, as His <hi>peculiar portion,</hi> out of all the Dayes of the Weeke, to be ſanctified wholly to His honour, whence the concluſion followes inevitably, <hi>That this Time, in all the reſpects of it, is a part of Gods worſhip,</hi> a part of the ſpeciall homage and tribute due to Him from all men; and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially accepted by Him.</p>
               <p>We proceede to another Argument,<note place="margin">IX. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. It is the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the firſt tab. e. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>[The obedience to, and obſervation of, a morall Commandement of the firſt table, is a part of Gods immediate worſhip. But the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the neceſſary ſufficient chiefe Time for Religion, is the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:112963:199"/>
obedience to, and obſervation of, a morall Commandement of the firſt table.</hi> Ergo, <hi>The obſervation of this Time, is a part of Gods immediate worſhip]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both the Propoſitions are confeſſed and granted by our <hi>Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>

                  </note> Therefore they muſt own the child iſſuing from ſuch Parents. The Major is thus expreſſed, <hi>[Whatſoever is morall is univerſally an eſſentiall part of Gods ſervice.]</hi> The Minor thus <hi>[The morall ſubſtance of the fourth Commandement is to have a Time regulate, frequent, &amp;c.]</hi> And generally they all ſpeake of a <hi>ſufficient Time as morall naturall.</hi> It is then a <hi>part of worſhip,</hi> a proper and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall part of it, by their own ſentence. But we will a little further prove and illuſtrate it alſo by our own grounds, and not depend upon them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Major,</hi> we ſay, That the Commandements of the firſt Table, do all of them plainly concerne the <hi>immediate worſhip and honour of God;</hi> and all the objects of thoſe Commandements, namely the things and actions outward or inward commanded in them, are matters of <hi>Divine worſhip.</hi> Therefore the obedience to thoſe Commandements, the obſervation of them muſt needs be a part of worſhip, of our <hi>Homage</hi> to God, and redound to His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate honour.</p>
               <p>For 2. Whatſoever is to be preſented to God, by vertue of a morall Commandement of the firſt table, is to be <hi>Preſented to Him, by all men, as a ſpeciall homage they all owe to Him,</hi> (as when a Landlord keeping court, requires all his tenants, to attend him ſuch dayes in a yeare, from ſuch an houre to ſuch an houre till he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe them, this Time as a part of their <hi>homage</hi> to him their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,) and as an <hi>immediate Honour</hi> to His Divine Majeſty, being ſo preſented; and accordingly it is certainly, ſpecially <hi>acceptable</hi> to Him. Therefore it is moſt properly a <hi>part of worſhip,</hi> and far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the nature of a meere adjunct or circumſtance: in that the deſcription of a <hi>part of worſhip,</hi> formerly given, fully agrees to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Gods <hi>Ceremonially</hi> poſitive command can make a thing, any thing,<note place="margin">

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:112963:199"/>
will of God</hi> requiring ſuch things as a part of <hi>His worſhip:</hi> much more muſt it be acknowledged, that a <hi>morall command</hi> of God (whether naturall or poſitive) for which a cleare, and morall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be alledged, that ſuch a command is to Gods <hi>ſpeciall Honour</hi> (as alſo to our <hi>great good,</hi>) muſt needs make the <hi>obedience</hi> to, and <hi>obſervation</hi> of any thing ſo commanded, a part of His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, without controll; unleſſe any will ſay, that a <hi>morall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> hath leſſe force in it then a ceremoniall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Minor,</hi> 1. That the <hi>neceſſary ſufficient chiefe Time</hi> for Religion is morall, even morall naturall; namely, that the <hi>law (and light) of nature</hi> commands, there ſhould be ſuch a Time obſerved, <hi>A Frequent Time of convenient Continuance neceſſary and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the chiefe Time;</hi> that is, we all muſt obſerve <hi>no leſſe</hi> ſo often; and <hi>no ſeldomer</hi> ſo much; But ſo much ſo oft is <hi>neceſſary:</hi> Again we neede obſerve no more ſo often, nor no oftener ſo much for the <hi>chiefe Time;</hi> But ſo much ſo oft <hi>is ſufficient:</hi> All this we have proved at large <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.

               </p>
               <p>A third Argument proceeds concerning the <hi>particular Day</hi> for the chiefe Time, that it alſo is a <hi>part of Worſhip,</hi>

                  <q>[That God ſhould have a Tribute of our Time for Publike VVorſhip, was never by any man denyed to be Morall and Naturall.]</q> By <hi>Tribute,</hi> he meanes, we ſuppoſe, a <hi>Part of VVorſhip;</hi> as <hi>Tribute</hi> paid to Kings, is a Part of the <hi>Homage</hi> and Honour due to them. 3. Another thus: <q>[The Heathens had their Feaſts and ſet Dayes conſecrated to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their gods.]</q> That is, (as we thinke he cannot but mean) Not only they did <hi>worſhip</hi> their gods on thoſe Dayes, but did obſerve thoſe Dayes as a <hi>part of worſhip,</hi> in <hi>honour</hi> of their gods. 4.
